        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As Europe emerges from lockdown and the successful vaccination campaign
fills us with optimism for the future, the Ecole Supérieure d&#39;Art et
Design Saint-Etienne (ESADSE), in collaboration with the Estonian
Academy of Art (EKA) and the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch-Gmünd
(HfG), its international partners, takes this opportunity to reflect on
the past year and a half and contemplate the reinvention of art and
design education in a post-Covid era. To address these crucial
questions, the Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration project was
initiated, co-funded by the Erasmus Program of the European Commission,
with the Bureau of Design Associations (BEDA) as an associated partner.</p>
<p>Higher education institutions have demonstrated remarkable adaptability
in response to the challenges posed by the pandemic crisis. We have
successfully transitioned to remote teaching and administrative
procedures. At ESADSE, courses, reports, and competitions have migrated
to the digital realm. The 2019-2020 activity report highlighted our
exemplary commitment. However, this transition came at a cost. It was
executed swiftly, driven by the urgency of the situation, utilizing
readily available digital tools. We trained ourselves on the go, often
outside of working hours, without conducting a thorough reflection on
the origins of these software, web apps, and applications.</p>
<p>In September 2021, as we returned to a semblance of &quot;normal,&quot; we began
reflecting on our experience, only to realize that it was far from over.
Our first observation was that we couldn&#39;t yet fully grasp the impact
of what had transpired. However, we collectively sensed that teaching
had undergone a profound transformation, and we couldn&#39;t simply revert
to the way things were before the crisis. The challenges we faced and
the questions that arose had left an indelible mark. Our second
observation was that while the tools we used allowed us to continue the
semester and stay connected, they were not well-suited for artistic
education and the unique types of interactions it requires.</p>
<p>During this time, we received an extraordinary call for projects from
the Erasmus+ program, specifically targeting the challenges brought
about by the health crisis and the periods of lockdown. The call was
structured around two main thematic strands: &quot;Preparing for digital
education,&quot; aimed at strengthening education and training systems to
effectively navigate the sudden shift to online and distance learning
prompted by the Covid-19 crisis, and &quot;Partnerships for Creativity,&quot;
designed to provide support to the cultural and creative sectors, which
have been particularly impacted by the health crisis.</p>
<p>In response to the call, Random() and the International Relations team
of ESADSE in Saint-Etienne, France, collaborated to develop a European
project focused on exploring digital tools for collaboration in art and
design. Implementing a European project requires the involvement of
multiple partners from different countries, with a minimum of three
partners being a condition for participation in the program. DTCC has
provided us with a valuable opportunity to collaborate with our
international partners from EKA and HfG, who share our concerns and
inquiries regarding art and design education.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="page article">
        <h2 id="what-is-the-aim-of-digital-tools-for-creative-collaboration">What is the aim of Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration?</h2>
<p>The aim of this art and design-oriented project is to engage teachers,
students, and staff from art and design schools in a collective
reflection on the challenges presented by online collaboration for
creative purposes. Through a critical lens, we seek to raise awareness
about &#39;good practices&#39; and the ecological impact of these new working
methods, as well as the responsibilities associated with data
processing, data security, etc. Additionally, this project provides a
valuable opportunity to collaborate with international partners who
share our concerns and inquiries about art and design education.</p>
<p>With the DTCC project, our aims are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a critical thinking regarding collaborative tools employed
within our schools.</li>
<li>Analyze the notions of collaboration, cooperation, contribution and
participation in relation to art and design practices.</li>
<li>Engage in collective prototyping of tools for creative collaboration
that align with our specific practices.</li>
<li>Conduct research on the development of situated tools for
collaborative projects by artists and designers.</li>
<li>Equip students, teachers and staff in art and design Higher
Education Institutions (HEIs) with the necessary skills and tools,
ensuring sustainable conditions for digital creative collaboration.</li>
<li>Involve students as collaborators by involving them in each step of
the project for pedagogical purposes.</li>
<li>Examine at our own international collaboration scenario as a case of study.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>To achieve these goals, the consortium has or will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct exploratory research on collaborative digital practices in
art and design higher schools.</li>
<li>Develop and test prototypes of collaborative games, software and
interfaces for the creative sector.</li>
<li>Create <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>, an online catalog of
participatory artistic collaborative projects based on digital
tools. The catalog can be accessed at:
<a href="https://ourcollaborative.tools/">ourcollaborative.tools</a></li>
<li>Present the project outputs through three exhibitions, one hosted at
each of the partner schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three intensive international workshops, serving as significant
milestones of the project, have been organized to actively engage and
involve all interested participants in the development of DTCC. The work
initiated during these brief workshops often continued during subsequent
classes.</p>
<p>Additionally, several events have taken place or are planned to showcase
the project&#39;s results and enable us to reach a wider audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>openschool.art</em> professional meetings and its presentation at the
<em>Le Monde Sinon Rien</em> exhibition during the Biennale Internationale
Design Saint-Etienne 2022. <em>openschool.art</em> had a second edition
organized by ENSAD Paris in March 2023.</li>
<li>IxDA Seminar at EKA Tallinn.</li>
<li>International Seminar Week (ISW) at HfG Schwäbisch-Gmünd;</li>
<li>OpenOpen event at ESAC Cambrai.</li>
<li>Exhibitions at EKA, HfG and ESADSE, each offering a similar yet
unique experience.</li>
</ul>

        <h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-this-publication">What is the purpose of this publication?</h2>
<h3 id="we-learn-from-experience">We learn from experience</h3>
<p>We learn and grow from our experiences, especially those that involve
long-term collaboration. The human factor plays a crucial role in design
projects, with designers often working in interdisciplinary teams. As
educators, a significant part of our responsibility is to support
students in developing the ability to work effectively in collaborative
situations, even when faced with challenges and complexities. The DTCC
project provided us with an immersive experience focused on (digital)
creative collaboration. It became a primary case study as we ourselves
worked together under difficult conditions - during the COVID and
post-COVID era, across different cultural backgrounds, and in the
English language. This experience has been immensely valuable, offering
valuable lessons for both students and teachers alike.</p>
<p>With this publication, our aim is to share the narrative of our
collaborative journey between EKA, HfG, and ESADSE as a starting point
for a global reflection on our pedagogical approaches. DTCC has been a
collective experience involving teachers, students, and staff from the
three schools. Throughout this process, we have critically examined the
purpose of our students&#39; training and the tools, including methods,
that underpin our teaching practices. Our collaboration has been
characterized by meetings, debates, and collective productions,
occasionally giving rise to friction that prompted us to challenge our
assumptions and explore diverse perspectives on digital design practices
and their instruction. For students, this project has represented a
significant opportunity to step out of their comfort zones, position
their practice within the broad spectrum of digital design, and
collaborate with individuals who bring distinct perspectives to the same
discipline and alternative approaches to project development.</p>
<p>We have constructed this publication based on the diverse activities and
associated productions that we have carried out over the past two years,
documenting them on a dedicated wiki platform created for the occasion.
These documents, written by several authors including students, serve as
a basis to examine the subject of design collaboration from a
pedagogical standpoint.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-overview-of-what-you-can-expect-to-find-in-this-publication">A brief overview of what you can expect to find in this publication</h3>
<p>In the first chapter, titled <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art//methodologies-and-tools-for-collaboration/">&quot;Methodologies and Tools for
Collaboration&quot;</a>, we reflect on our initial workshop at EKA. This
workshop provided us with the opportunity to meet in person for the
first time, and we quickly realized that expecting seamless
collaboration without prior knowledge of each other&#39;s expectations and
work habits was somewhat utopian. Prior to, during, and after the
workshop, we made concerted efforts to collectively define the scope of
our subject, establish the current state of the art, and determine
effective ways of collaborating over the following months.</p>
<p>In the upcoming chapter, titled <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art//Encounter-between-different-approaches-to-digital-art-and-design-pedagogies/">&quot;Encounter between different approaches to digital art and design pedagogies,&quot;</a> each school will present its
pedagogical approach and the distinctive aspects of its program.
Additionally, we will introduce the <em>openschool.art</em> professional
meetings, which were initiated as part of the project and focus on
addressing the challenges involved in teaching digital practices within
art and design schools.</p>
<p>In the chapter <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art//Learning-to-collaborate-with-different-perspectives/">&quot;Learning to Collaborate with Different Perspectives&quot;</a>,
we reflect on the workshops held at ESADSE and HfG, where explored
creative collaboration strategies. Additionally, we provide a platform
for the students to share their testimonies, shedding light on their
experiences and the significance of this two-year collaboration for them.</p>
<p>Then, in the chapter <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art//designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/">&quot;Designing Tools for Creative Collaboration&quot;</a>, we
continue documenting our workshops at HfG and showcase the interfaces
and prototypes of the collaboration tools created by students.
Additionally, we include two articles by designers whose work revolves
around the development of tools and collective practices. Furthermore,
we introduce <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>, an online platform that we are
currently building. This platform serves as a participatory archive of
artistic projects involving digital devices and collaborative endeavors.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the chapter <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art//making-exhibitions-as-a-collective-and-pedagogical-practice/">&quot;Making Exhibitions as a Collective and Pedagogical Practice&quot;</a>, we will discuss our intention of organizing
three exhibitions of the DTCC project, hosted individually at each of
the partner schools. We will explore how this endeavor aligns with our
pedagogical approaches and discuss the ways in which the exhibition
format is linked to our educational practices.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy reading this publication and that our experiences and
reflections resonate with your own.</p>

    <div class="page article">
        <h2 id="how-is-it-made">How is it made?</h2>
<p>Over the course of two years, we collaborated utilizing various sharing
and communication tools, many of which were already implemented in our
schools, such as Google Drive, Zoom, etc. Additionally, we utilized
specific tools installed and used for the project, including Yunohost,
Big Blue Button, Nextcloud, and a wiki built using wiki.js. Through
these platforms, we gathered a substantial amount of material,
documentation, and images to contribute to our publication.The
publication is available in both a printable PDF format and as a website
accessible at the provided URL: <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art">digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art</a>.</p>
<p>From the outset, all the documentation and archives were conceptualized
as part of a hybrid publication chain, integrating various formats and
open-source tools. This editorial chain involves the wiki, markdown
files, images, and web-based applications that enable us to extract
content from the wiki and generate diverse publication formats. It
serves as a collaborative creation tool, facilitating the production of
our publications in different forms. The development of this chain has
been made possible thanks to the contributions and support of the free
software community.</p>
<p>Please note that the contents compiled in this edition embody a sense of
fragility. This fragility arises from the evolution of our perspectives
throughout the exchanges, workshops, and productions related to the
project, regarding both the subject matter and our methods. As a result,
the editorial design was approached incrementally, and the texts were
collaboratively written by multiple contributors.</p>
<p>This publication is the second version and was generated the <strong>21 november 2023</strong> from the modified content of our wiki.
A custom application was built based on <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a> markup language, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a> runtime environment,
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy.js</a> static site generator and the <a href="https://pagedjs.org/">paged.js</a> web to print library.</p>

        <h1 id="methodologies-and-tools-for-collaboration">Methodologies and Tools for Collaboration</h1>
<p>Tools allow us to practice, while practicing allows us to build these
tools. The artist and designer community, who have a keen interest in
digital practices, has been utilizing this recipe for quite some time
now. At Saint-Etienne Higher School of Art and Design, our pedagogy is
based on this principle. Since the very beginning, we&#39;ve had plenty
exchanges with our students regarding the use of these tools. The
integration of communication, sharing and design tools into our creative
practices has had a significant impact on the way we approach and
express our creativity. This project has displayed the varying degrees
to which each team, school and country cultivates its unique culture of
relationships with technology, particularly with digital technology.</p>
<p>It is indeed a struggle to distance ourselves from these topics: As
professionals, students, and teachers, we find ourselves entangled in
socio-politico-economic systems that our practices actively participate
in. Addressing these fundamental questions becomes crucial for shaping
the future, especially amidst the climate and political challenges that
lie ahead in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>This project which lasted two years, was rich in exchanges and
experiences, and had an indisputable effect on us, especially on our
students: questioning and critical positioning towards our methods and
utilization of digital creative tools through collaborative efforts. It
became clear that tools and methods we impart are not neutral: they are
indeed part of the creative process and have a lot of influence on
projects as well as on students, on the way they work and on their
designs. Our practices encompass a mix of art, hacking, tinkering,
product design as well as the use of both proprietary and free software.
However, each school approaches pedagogy with its own unique
perspective, adapting toolboxes and methods that directly influence the
professional world in which we prepare our students. Within the
framework of the DTCC project, we had the opportunity to voice our
concerns while enabling different approaches to coexist.</p>
<p>Even though we have encountered some challenges in our collaboration,
the encounter of our distinct practices regarding design and teaching
proved to be highly enriching. This project gave us the chance to share
and compare our methodologies and tools; analyzing their modalities,
origins and realities in our institutions and also in professional
contexts, while allowing students to think both individually and
collectively about their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><img src="img/img_8701.jpg" alt="img_8701.jpg"></p>
<figcaption>First DTCC workshop at EKA in Tallinn</figcaption>

<p>The first workshop in Tallinn was a significant milestone as it marked
our first in-person meeting after having numerous fruitful exchanges
beforehand through platforms like Zoom and Big Blue Button. However, due
to unforeseen circumstances, we had to quickly synchronize our
expectations and adapt to the situation. Unfortunately, the initial plan
for an in-person meeting was canceled, and we didn&#39;t have the
opportunity to properly meet face to face. This unexpected turn of
events was mainly influenced by the challenges posed by the Covid-19
pandemic, which greatly impacted the organization of our collaborative
work during the first week.</p>
<p>In October 2021, we finally had the opportunity to meet in person at
EKA, Tallinn, bringing together both students and teachers. The week
proved to be intense and pedagogically challenging, particularly because
the students from Esadse had a strong inclination towards the Google
Sprint model and design thinking methods proposed by EKA, which are
commonly employed by our partners. However, the focus of the workshop
was on the students&#39; experiences of remote learning and collaborative
work, highlighting the isolation they faced during the pandemic.</p>
<h3 id="subject-and-goals-of-the-workshop">Subject and goals of the workshop</h3>
<p>Since the first workshop was being held after the pandemic and DTCC
project emerging from its aftermath, discussions around the workshop
were obviously based on our experiences of teaching, learning and
working together remotely. This week was dedicated to the inventory of
tools we use for remote collaboration and to exchanging &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;
experiences we had with them. This served as a basis to a common
reflection on what tools could have been better or complementary to
those we have, in order to ease remote collaborations or to allow new
ways of creating together at a distance.</p>
<p>During the whole project, workshops have been one of the important means
to involve students at every step of the way. This one is part of the
first phase of the DTCC project, dedicated to exploratory research (that
was documented by EKA in an other publication, here, we intend to
document this workshop from a pedagogical perspective). The main goal of
this workshop was to encourage students to engage in analyzing the
digital tools used for collaboration during the pandemic and reflecting
on lack of tools. These two outlooks were both important to the study
and to the researchers.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="introduction-projects-and-methods">Introduction: projects and methods</h3>
<p>As an introduction, some of the students as well as some of the teachers
presented their previous works and ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekaterina Suharenko, Conversations with the Water: Experiencing Life-Centered Design</li>
<li>Marc Guntow and Ludwig Kannicht, Hybrid Workplaces</li>
<li>Hugo Saksik, Hardware controllers for digital graphic design</li>
<li>Samantha Zannoni, Create drawing tools</li>
</ul>
<p>The EKA team led by Tanel Karp and Jekaterina Suharenko had prepared a
precise and busy program: the methodological model was strongly inspired
by a Google Sprint. The main idea was to find an efficient and
well-documented format to work together in a short time, combining
creativity exercises, meetings and design workshops. Marc Guntow and
Ludwig Kannicht are familiar with this type of format, and from the very
first hours they provided exercises to form working groups by topic.
Methodological tools were offered during the week to guide the
students&#39; responses.</p>
<p>For example, Marc introduced us to the <em>Four-Step Sketch</em> method, an
exercise that helps people to create well-formed concepts through a
structured process that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing key information</li>
<li>Starting design work on paper</li>
<li>Considering multiple variations</li>
<li>Creating a detailed solution</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="talks-and-visits">Talks and visits</h3>
<p>The EKA team proposed meetings with designers, artists and visits to
their workplace to build interviews and gather data for exploratory
research in professional contexts. Each group went to talk about the
topics identified in the previous sessions as well as more generic
topics such as: how do you work and with what kind of tools? Do you use
pre-defined methods? How do you collaborate with one another as well as
with external collaborators or clients?</p>
<p>They had a video call with Annie Abrahams and visited:</p>
<ul>
<li>TRINIDAD WISEMAN</li>
<li>Pipedrive</li>
<li>DUX</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="projects-made-by-students">Projects made by students</h3>
<p>During the workshop, many topics based on our experiences during the
quarantine period, were expressed, from the best to the worst
situations.</p>
<p>The best and the worst situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>on technical environment (how we depend on internet connection,
accidental microphone on, etc.)</li>
<li>on social behavior (it is hard to get feedback, can or cannot be a
peaceful moment for introvert people, etc.)</li>
<li>on cognitive overload (concentration problems, headaches, etc.)</li>
<li>on self-organization (wider possibilities to attend lectures, saving
travelling time, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the material was gathered, the teams met to define their objectives
and discuss the data collected.</p>
<p>Four topics were chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>online social behavior, politics</li>
<li>emotional bonds</li>
<li>work/life balance</li>
<li>motivation and creativity</li>
</ul>
<p>We quickly understood that it was not reasonable to think of devices or
software. As we realized that we work in very different manners and are
used to make distinct types of productions, we spent a lot of time on
discussions and negotiations. Some interesting debates were initiated by
students and we decided to give them space to grow by exploring the
topics in depth and project them into situations.</p>
<p>At the end of each days, teams made a presentation of their progress and
documented their paths on our collaborative wiki.</p>
<h4 id="emotional-bonds">Emotional bonds</h4>
<p>There is a strong connection between emotional bonds and creativity. The group is creating a social link about the rituals (individual, or
social) #emotionalbond #privatespace #personalexperience. What is a
ritual? Why is it important to share?</p>
<p>The group has come up with an idea for a gardening app, inspired by the
theme of rituals. They have brainstormed the elements that will be
included in their product, identified the target users, considered the
user experience, designed the interface prototype, and created user
stories. They have also completed the prototyping phase and will further develop the visualization.</p>
<p>They wanted to create a gardening community where people can grow
together while still having their own individual experiences. The
results would be shared among the community members, fostering a sense
of collective participation. The digital tool aims to reinforce
interpersonal relationships by addressing questions such as how it will
function, how people will feel a sense of belonging to the community,
how it will create meaning, and how it can be inclusive. </p>
<p>They have designed a system that is free from hierarchy.</p>
<p>The group wants to make a prototype of how the platform will look like
and what experiences it would create (interactive communication):</p>
<ul>
<li>be in contact communication but without a tuff structure</li>
<li>NFC scanner to be sure that the person is present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gardening is about responsibilities, so it is very important to be
present. Scan the code and see who the gardener is.</p>

<p>Audio is often overlooked, yet it plays a crucial role. We need to
identify the problem we aim to solve. How can we make audio more
personalized? How can we enhance personal interaction in digital
communication? The theme of sound was not given much attention during
the discussions. How can we bring energy and liveliness to participant
communication during calls? These are the questions we need to address.
We should consider the target audience and the specific context in which
we are designing. #team #collaboration #sound</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to enhance motivation during study and work
sessions, as well as lectures. Many of us have a deep connection with
sound. The group came up with the idea of jamming sessions using
microphones. This provides musicians with a unique opportunity to engage
in digital collaborations, as it is a playful way of utilizing digital
tools. It also allows for connections with different musicians. The
group explored potential issues with delays and is focused on creating a fun and creative atmosphere while using this tool. They are also
exploring a more gamified experience and have been inspired by various
references.</p>
<p>Perhaps we will show the references tomorrow during the presentation.
Groups express the need to envision the visual interface concept,
considering aspects such as sound communication, whether it includes a
camera, chatting capabilities, or other features. Sound is a way of
communication. They have also created wireframes to determine the
elements they want to incorporate into this tool. Musicians and
non-musicians are involved in this process, aiming to achieve radical
simplicity. They are considering factors such as the session start time,
instrument choices, and the ability to control access to the jamming
space. Addressing the issue of delay in live sessions is a challenge
they need to overcome. The goal is to enable multiple participants to
contribute sounds to an existing &#39;music&#39; piece. They are exploring
options for simplified instrument choices. Their main focus is to grasp
the system&#39;s functionality and establish a basic premise for the
project.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>This tool is not to be utilized by professional musicians since it might not fully meet their requirements or expectations. However, musicians
could potentially create a library that allows other users to explore
and engage with it. This goes beyond the limits of design bubble,
inviting anyone who is interested in music to participate. It is a tool
designed for creative people, allowing them to freely express themselves
without necessarily knowing how to play a physical instrument.</p>

<p>The problem we encountered was trying to understand why we are here
together in this workshop. After a long discussion and sharing several
insights gained from an interview that took place earlier that day with
Annie Abrahams and Ülo Vihma, we had a dot-voting session to gauge our
ideas. We collectively arrived at the idea of developing a <em>transpire</em>
platform which consists various formats such as discussion mode,
presentation mode, and classroom mode. We established clear roles for
each participant in the conversation, determining who they are and the
specific roles they play. Additionally, we discussed the importance of
gathering feedback in real-time while a person is presenting. How we
want to get feedback while the person is presenting. For example, we can
use emojis to show if we agree or disagree. The way how people
communicate during the pandemic has changed tremendously, people started
using corporation platforms like Zoom, Google Meets, Slack etc., as
opposed to the traditional classroom interactions that were prevalent
before.</p>
<p>During one-on-one debates and discussions, we asked what digital space
can provide while not being a physical space; what is the role of
individuals, what would be the different characters, relationships and
responsibilities towards actions. They aimed to introduce certain
functionalities related to user interaction. For example, participants
within the Zoom ecosystem engage in digital interactions both as
individuals and as members of the community.</p>
<p>How to represent one&#39;s self when in a digital space? For instance, we
reflected on the camera mode while trying to explore alternative forms
of representation. This includes options like choosing a color or a
drawing to express oneself, recognizing that not everyone may feel at
ease appearing on video. Additionally, our considerations expanded to
more experimental avenues, such as incorporating sound.</p>
<p>We haven&#39;t discussed further about distinct modes, such as switch modes.
It is possible to choose pre-settings (structure or default settings
that will help the user to be more engaged). There would be only one
tool where the user can switch modes easily so the software could adapt
accordingly. However, we haven&#39;t tested it yet. We experienced Zoom
during the lockdown. Sometimes, discussions might not work so well, and
breakout rooms might not be the best solution. We have made it an
obligation to say goodbye, thank you for the lesson, and switching the
microphone on. But there was always something missing. In the digital
space, there are certain limitations. It is crucial to recognize that
digital and physical mediums have distinct characteristics. Therefore,
we took a step back to evaluate our actual needs and explore how we can
use these specific elements to improve the overall experience. By
considering the unique context of social interaction, we must be prudent
about proposing romantic scenarios, as it raises ethical questions that
require careful consideration. While we haven&#39;t yet thought about the
graphic interface, our focus is more on developing the features.</p>

<h4 id="worklife-balance">Work/life balance</h4>
<p>Our topic is separating work and personal life. The idea was to create a
&quot;buddy&quot;, connected to the calendar. There are multiple ways of using
this feature; firstly, the buddy notifying you to take breaks, secondly
approach incorporates physical cubes that can be interacted with on a
tactile level, offering various work modes, as well as providing
exercises to offer help to deal with stress. If you are stressed, the
app tracks it down and notifies you about it, helps you reflect on your
day, and your achievements. The buddy helps you not to have a burn out
and organize your life in a more ecological way.</p>
<p>Start with setting up your mode cube to enter your mood, your team,
enter time while checking in and checking out, accomplishments of the
day and planning of the next days, as well as giving you the opportunity
to share it all between users.</p>
<p>Next step is to create a storyboard to help you organize your day. It is
a two-way communication: the app will give you advice on how to make you
less stressed, encourage you to take a walk and get away from the screen
to be able to separate the work time and personal life.</p>
<p>The questions are multiple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who should be in charge to program the buddy: a friend, a colleague, or a psychologist?</li>
<li>How to prevent an addiction towards the buddy while allowing the users continue to listen to themselves?</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this data can be used in both ways, it can empower both parties.</p>
<p>Various forms of analytics can be generated, encompassing personal data
and addressing potential concerns related to privacy. The buddies can
foster a community-like environment, where friends come together to
discuss and enhance their collaborative work processes.</p>
<p>The buddy was created with the aim of helping people to not to overwork
themselves.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-and-openings">Conclusion and openings</h3>
<p>The biggest interest in this workshop was seeing our different
approaches on tools, methods and projects; which was also the most
difficult and tiring part of the process. We were actually surprised to
see how different we were, but it is now what we consider to be the
strongest point of our collaboration. However, with the benefit of
hindsight, we can allow ourselves to say that if we were to repeat the
whole process, our differentiating methods and perspectives on design
and tools would be the core of our first workshop together.</p>
<p>Reflecting back on October 2021: Following a week of rich experience,
discussion, and thinking, each school went to back to its country of
origin. We had prepared a Wikipage to gather and document all the work,
which is the tool we have improved during the project and that we are
using currently for this publication. During the following months, each
school integrated the process of ideation, design and implementation of
mock-ups, interfaces and prototypes into their respective curricula.
This unification was influenced by the concepts and advancements
generated during the week-long session in Estonia.</p>

<p>After a few months, following the first workshop at EKA in Tallinn, our
students continued their researches by building new teams. Each school,
according to its organization and its academic calendar, has integrated
the subjects evoked during the initial workshops into its curriculum and
pedagogy.</p>
<p>An online final presentation of the students&#39; projects was planned on
the 18th February 2022 to share the results. Here are the projects they
have designed.</p>

<h4 id="how-did-i-came-up-with-this-idea">How did I came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>To begin with, I have identified some research questions for the
project: What kind of digital tools do people use for collaboration?
Why? How do they collaborate online by using these tools? What kind of
problems do they have? etc. Based on those questions, I conducted desk
research and interviews with people who have experience in both office
and remote working.</p>
<p>Based on my research findings, I found that the absence of small, quick
interactions and feedback while working online could slow down the work.
Addition to that, while remote working, text-based communication is
increasingly replacing oral communication and non-verbal forms of
communication. Text-based communication helps communication to be more
accurate and well-structured while being also suitable for recording.
However, at the same time, text-based communication is time consuming
and compared to oral communication, makes it more difficult to express
feelings and emotions. Based on these findings, I decided to focus on
the problem concerning the lack of quick and concise feedback while
working online.</p>

<figcaption>Researchs for the video calls plugin to check-in and out</figcaption>

<h4 id="why-is-this-tool-for-1">Why is this tool for?</h4>
<p>This plugin is a video meeting tool specifically designed for check-in
and check-out questions. It is already being used by many design teams.
It functions as a seatbelt to identify if someone needs help or can
provide support to others.</p>
<p>The check-in would be about warming up, checking on each other, sharing
something personal in order to create a digital environment where you
can connect with each other; whereas the check-out would be more about
reflecting, appreciation and feedback.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-this-tool-for-1">Who is this tool for?</h4>
<p>This plugin is made for remote workers&#39; teams and online classes.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-work-1">How does it work?</h4>
<p>An individual, for instance the moderator writes a check-in question
that aligns with the current session. Using a personalized question
often demonstrates a genuine interest, but there is also the option to
generate a question if inspiration is needed. Afterwards, the question
is answered in turn, with visual cues indicating the current speaker and
those who are yet to respond. If someone does not want to answer the
check-in question, they can press a button to change their status
without necessarily answering the question.</p>
<p>After everyone has answered the question, the meeting can start.</p>
<p>When you leave the meeting, you will be automatically redirected to the
check-out room, where a pre-existing or generated question related to
appreciation, feedback, or self-reflection will appear. The answers
given are visible either anonymously or with respondent&#39;s name depending
on the group&#39;s default settings. Considering that some individuals may
need to leave early, the concept is for everyone to individually submit
their check-out remarks, which will then be stored.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-i-came-up-with-this-idea-1">How did I came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>After the workshop week, we cleared/reverted all that we had discussed.
Within the EKA team, we discussed about different kind of collaborative
apps and our shared experiences with them so far. In order to identify
patterns and issues across different categories, we made the decision to
divide them. Together with Quinn, we conducted a research on the topic
of communication.</p>
<p>To generate an HMW (How Might We) statement, we reviewed the complaints
and praises shared about the five tools we had previously assessed. We
gathered quotes from Quora and Reddit regarding topics such as &quot;What are
the benefits of Slack?&quot; or &quot;What are the pros and cons in Zoom?&quot;. Each
quote was carefully tagged with relevant keywords for further analysis.
We collected quotes from Quora and reddit on entries like &quot;What are the
benefits of Slack?&quot; Or &quot;What are the pros and cons in Zoom.&quot; All
these quotes were marked with keywords. I added quotes from brief
guerrilla interviews to the same table. Among the various issues and
recurring patterns, we observed, the comments that resonated with me the
most were related to Zoom&#39;s inability to create a social environment and
its contribution to feelings of loneliness and distance.</p>
<p>My first approach to generate ideas was the Crazy 8 Method. During this
stage, I sketched various solutions for my HMW statement, exploring
possibilities such as improving feedback mechanisms, adding features to
facilitate emotional expression, and creating a safe space for
discussing personal matters. So, I started to read articles what kind of
games were suggested for remote teams to let the team spirit grow. The
problem I saw with many of those online games, like a photo competition,
was that often they take a lot of effort to prepare or can be only
played one time, but then I stumbled on an article about Team Check-Ins
and Check-Outs.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-this-tool-for-2">Why is this tool for?</h4>
<p>The final concept is a Slack plug-in that showcases the user&#39;s soft
skills, hard skills and tools that they possess, which would facilitate
more efficient collaboration within their team. Such a plug-in would
also overcome barriers of shyness, inviting people to seek assistance in
a more confident way, thereby igniting a sense of mentorship and
promoting learning.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-it-work-2">How does it work?</h4>
<p>The user would input their top skills, which would then appear on a
hexagon graph. This graph would help team members identifying who they
can approach for assistance or collaboration Additionally, it would
serve as a display to individuals outside the organization</p>
<p>After each collaboration, the other user can provide feedback by
&#39;endorsing&#39; the user&#39;s existing skills or suggesting new skills.</p>
<p>The graph will always display the top six skills, both in soft and hard
skills, that have received the most endorsements. If a new skill
surpasses the endorsements of one of the existing top skills, the new
skill will replace the previous one on the graph, and the cycle
continues.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-i-came-up-with-this-idea-2">How did I came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>As a team, we&#39;ve spent the first two weeks trying to understand the
world of collaborative applications. During this time, our focus was on
identifying the main players, understanding their Unique Selling Points
(USPs), studying their competitors, and searching for relevant blogs,
videos and other resources about these key applications. In addition, we
took the time to speak with individuals who actively use the identified
applications. Our aim was to understand their engagement patterns,
uncover their pain points, gather their preferences, and learn about the
challenges they have encountered and how they resolved them.</p>
<p>When checking the data collected by the team, two patterns stood out to
me. The first pattern revealed a group of individuals who lacked
knowledge or proper training on using the applications, resulting in
their inability to fully leverage the available features. The second one
showed a confident and proficient group who could easily work with the
applications.</p>
<p>What if the second group was able to guide the first group? This led me
to consider the following: How can we foster a meaningful connection
across a group using digital tools, enabling members to support each
other equally in their personal growth?</p>

<h4 id="why-is-this-tool-for-3">Why is this tool for?</h4>
<p>Based on the research, analysis and understanding of the popular, most
useful &amp; almost standard tools that have become part of our daily life,
we designed the concept of <strong>a plug-in for spontaneous collaborative
drawn art</strong> we called Yarte.</p>
<p>The concept supports the idea of providing help, motivation, and
inspiration by creating a context. It aims to offer an accessible
first-hand experience in a creative environment for individuals who want
to join or have access to the world of drawn-art. The specific purposes
of this concept include visual communication of work, ideas, plans, and
more.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-work-3">How does it work?</h4>
<p>We decided for it to be a plug-in that could be used as a complement for
the work that being done in other digital tools, with the purpose of
replicating the facility and experience of having a notebook for
sketching ideas. The difference within the notebook experience and the
plug-in &quot;yarte&quot; would be the support and instant follow up that the
tool will provide to the user, based on the &quot;context&quot; given by the
user themselves.</p>
<h4 id="what-type-of-collaboration-is-it-made-for-1">What type of collaboration is it made for?</h4>
<p>With this approach to the digital tools, we found the potential for this
facility of creation to become a collaborative environment in the open
platform for people to test-advertise their artwork as NFT&#39;s in order
to have access to the statistic that would be proof &amp; reference of the
usage and audience that their work reaches.</p>
<p>The value of these scheme is in the value of data and previous
experience in the current professional work career building, especially
in the art and creative fields.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-we-came-up-with-this-idea">How did we came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>After the workshop week, all the students from EKA formed a team in
order to gather a more integral research on the topic of the digital
tools that are part of our everyday life. This helped us to identify
what are the interfaces, interaction &amp; practices that had an area of
opportunity to be improved. During our research upon the existing
digital tools, and more specifically about the most popular ones, we
found interesting &amp; defining quotes and statements on the comments,
reviews and websites on those. </p>
<p>These findings led us to establish our own conclusions between the popular opinion and our own experience and expectation when using digital tools for creativity and &amp; or for collaboration.</p>
<p><img src="img/yarte!_3.jpg" alt="yarte!_3.jpg"></p>
<figcaption>Reflection on existing digital tools for creative work mindmap</figcaption>

<p>In the next stage of our research, we have clarified the differences
between existing tools and identified why not everyone is using the same
ones. These tools offer unique features within the same category, but
who are they specifically designed for? What factors help individuals
decide which tool aligns better with their needs or personal
identification?</p>
<p>Among a variety of answers, additional questions, and conclusions, we
have identified a specific difference that distinguishes tools providing
easy access to a world of possibilities (1) from those that replicate
tools for putting one&#39;s practiced talent or skill into action beyond
the confines of a screen. (2):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1) corresponds to the &quot;Accessibility&quot; category</strong> of digital
tools, which represents the programs and apps and websites that
allow one to explore an alien world, far from our real abilities
and/or possibilities, but very close to our imagination and desires.
It suggests and facilitate tools that might only be available in the
digital world, but also regular or analog tools with exponential
&quot;power&quot; or &quot;capacity&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>(2) is the &quot;Possibilities&quot; category</strong>, which addresses tools,
programs, apps, and websites that offer specific functionalities
replicating high-fidelity analog tools. These tools facilitate the
user&#39;s capability to represent desired outcomes with ease through
the utilization of screens, while also granting access to a diverse
range of digital tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>We concluded that experience is equally applied in both cases, yet in
different forms (instinct and ability). Furthermore, we identified that
intuition serves as the driving force that motivates users to continue
using or experimenting with the tools, facilitating the acquisition of
expertise and knowledge in specific digital environments or toolsets.</p>
<p>While identifying these two approaches to creativity in the digital
world, we realized that despite its potential for providing
possibilities, it can also be limiting for inexperienced users. The
instinct we mentioned earlier can only exist and be effective when one
has had the opportunity to gain experience within specific environments.</p>
<p>However, what about the people who would like to explore untapped
abilities that they believe they possess or wish to acquire? Joining the
digital world is no longer only an option or an alternative. For sure,
certain aspects can and should be preserved in analog and physical
experiences, yet digital tools should support and enhance how we
represent our ideas and enable the easy distribution of messages
worldwide in today&#39;s interconnected age.</p>
<p>That is why we chose to focus on this question: &quot;What happens when the
references that most digital tools are built upon do not align with your
own experiences or references?&quot; Not identifying with a particular world
does not mean that our instinct will be turned off when faced with
mismatched references and archives. Instead, it will operate based on
the possibilities it has been exposed to and execute accordingly.</p>
<p>Indeed, we observed that when a contextual starting point is given, engagement becomes more natural and works as an engine or motor for the references in our minds to start constructing and creating.</p>

<p>curious.me is a mobile app designed to arouse and encourage curiosity, a
quality that is often lost by daily stress, lack of time, and various
other factors. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbates
this issue as many people miss out on the exchange with others while
working from home, resulting in a lack of new impressions and

interesting topics and the opportunity to delve deeper into the topics.
Value is placed on getting the user out of his &quot;bubble&quot; and offering him
topics that he has hardly or not at all dealt with before. This ensures
new stimuli and areas of interest, and thus the chance to arouse

<h4 id="why-is-this-tool-for-5">Why is this tool for?</h4>
<p>MOSAIC is a collaboration tool for artists to work together on creative
projects. This is to simplify working remotely in agencies and with
other artists around the world and combine multiple workspaces into one.</p>
<p>Isolation Kills Creativity: a lot of artists, especially illustrators,
work very isolated and the pandemic has made this issue even more
severe. In times like these we are lacking outside influences and
inspiration from others.</p>
<p>MOSAIC brings community back into remote work and allows for agencies
and independent illustrators to create their own illustrations together.
In its focus stand communication and collaboration, which make the users
feel close to their colleagues, even if they are worlds apart. Working
with artists around the world gives the opportunity to explore new art
styles and combine them in one artwork. The goal for this tool was also
to make interdisciplinary work possible, by including animators or
authors into the project.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-this-tool-for-4">Who is this tool for?</h4>
<p>MOSAIC is made for isolated artists and designer (especially for

<p>As well as other special features that allow for easier communication,
such as a voice chat or the option to ask your colleagues for advice on
an artwork. These collaborative features separate MOSAIC from your
ordinary drawing tool like Procreate, Illustrator or Photoshop.</p>

<p>Free culture (social movement, subculture, philosophy) is largely
derived from free software, but is much broader and includes other
aspects (music, food, movies). It promotes certain beliefs such as the
fact that knowledge and learning should be available to all, that no
entity should dominate others. It induces a form of horizontality by
distributing power among the members of the community. There is an
asymmetrical relationship between the engineer who designs, who owns the
knowledge, and the user who uses, does not know, and is potentially
used. We feel the need to reclaim the tools, to understand them and to
regain sovereignty over them.</p>

<h4 id="wave-of-specialists">Wave of specialists</h4>
<p>Participants in the project will each choose a digital drawing tool of
their choice. They will also choose and/or design one or more digital
formats to experiment with during the drawing process. Participants must
agree on the number of colors or shades of gray that can be used and the
choice of the background color.</p>
<p>The participants divide up the roles in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#39;contour designer(s)&#39;: One or more individuals draw several
imprecise shapes for the figure drawer(s) to refine.</li>
<li>The &#39;figure drawer(s)&#39;: One or more individuals transform the
shapes into figures.</li>
<li>The &#39;shade and contrast designer(s)&#39;: One or more individuals handle colors and contrasts.</li>
<li>The &#39;detail designer(s)&#39;: One or more individuals add graphic details such as patterns, textures, gradients, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The participants agree on the export and the final format of the
composition. It is possible to double the roles by assigning the
decoration to one group and the characters to another.</p>
<h4 id="rumor-of-a-sentence">Rumor of a sentence</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each participant uses the digital medium of their choice to draw.</li>
<li>Participants decide together the order in which they will draw.</li>
<li>One of the participants opens a book to any page and reads the first
sentence they find.</li>
<li>From this sentence, the first participant will draw a picture for 5
minutes.</li>
<li>The first participant sends their drawing to the second participant,
who will reproduce or modify it loyal to original in 5 minutes on
their format before sending it to the next participant, so on until
the last participant.</li>
<li>Participants design a composition by combining their drawing, the
signatures of each participant and the original sentence using an
online sharing tool or by designating a member of the group to share
their screen and manipulate the elements.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="talking-drawing">Talking drawing</h4>
<p>Participants choose whether or not to time themselves. Participants form
groups of four. The roles to be distributed are the draftsman, the
colorist, the graphic designer and the writer. Together, they choose a
medium and a format and take turns. The order is determined by the team.</p>
<ul>
<li>The designer draws the elements of the composition.</li>
<li>The colorist takes care of the color and textures.</li>
<li>The graphic designer prepares a text area.</li>
<li>The writer chooses one or more typefaces and writes a text related
to the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The groups present their work to the others and choose to put them
together or a way to present them that distinguishes them. It would be
interesting to reverse the order and see the effect. It is possible to
combine the tasks and form groups of two.</p>
<h4 id="cycles">Cycles</h4>
<p>One participant performs a trace. Another participant performs another
one, close to the first one. The operation is repeated until all
participants feel that the traces form a satisfactory and
well-structured composition. Variation(s): Participants can choose to
move or distort elements rather than draw. The protocol can be performed
without using speech.</p>
<h4 id="chewable-fictions">Chewable Fictions</h4>
<p>Participants determine a running order by drawing lots, alphabetical
order, &quot;plopping&quot; or any other possible technique.
The first participant represents a scene including a setting, a
character and an action. Following the direction of play, the next
participant represents the next scene. The protocol ends when a
participant concludes the story. The participants give a title to this
story.</p>
<h4 id="mise-en-abyme">Mise en abyme</h4>
<p>Participants determine the order of passage using various techniques
like drawing lots, alphabetical order, using a counting-out game or
other methods. All participants choose a common area and zoom in to the
maximum. The first participant begins by drawing within the zoomed-in
area. The second participant then zooms out slightly and incorporates
the first participant&#39;s drawing into their own.</p>
<p>This process continues as each subsequent participant zooms out slightly
and adds their contribution, including the previous realizations. The
action repeats until the zoom out is exhausted. As a variation,
participants can try completing the activity within a specified time
limit.</p>
<h4 id="i-write-a-drawing">I write a drawing</h4>
<p>Participants take turns writing a sentence on the page. The sentences do
not necessarily have to be logical. Each participant deconstructs the
sentence of the previous participant in order to compose an
illustration.The participants give one or more titles to the final compositions. Alternatives: It is possible to allow the distortion of lines, the creation of new drawings after their destructuring or to limit the time.</p>
<p>One sentence less, one drawing more.</p>

<h4 id="why-is-this-tool-for-7">Why is this tool for?</h4>
<p>While contemporary digital collaboration design often focuses on remote
communication, Graphic Jam proposes to transform the computer back into
a machine which physically brings people together. It transcribes the
communication experience of local multiplayer video games into a graphic
design context.</p>
<p>I envision a few use cases for this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A jam tool for graphic designers</strong>: As the entire process of
creating a graphic is a very &quot;hands-on&quot; approach, interesting
results can be created quite quickly. It can be used as a kind of
warm up tool for fueling new ideas in an informal and fun setting.</li>
<li><strong>An installation displayed in an exhibition context:</strong> The way of
generating graphics and posters with the tool is a straight-forward
process and is a nice for giving a public insight into a graphic
design process and the effects of experimenting with shapes, colors,
fonts, images, superpositions...</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-is-this-tool-for-6">Who is this tool for?</h4>
<p>Graphic Jam is both made for graphic designers (experts) and for the
public (non-experts) to learn the basis of graphic design process
through experimentation.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-work-8">How does it work?</h4>
<p>Developed with Processing, the graphic generator features a vector
editor based on bezier curves, a bitmap editor and a font editor. This
software must be simultaneously operated by two people using gamepads,
as the graphic functions require cooperation and communication in order
to unleash their full potential. The tactile approach leads to an
instinctive workflow as well as happy accidents and therefore,
interesting visuals results emerge swiftly straight from the first jam.</p>
<p><strong>Shape editor:</strong> The first &quot;tool&quot; or experiment that I developed is a
shape editor based on bezier curves. The nature of the design of
traditional computer input peripherals, such as keyboards, is to be used
by one individual. Even if we manage to squeeze in front of the computer
in order to use one keyboard simultaneously, we certainly can&#39;t do the
same thing for only one mouse. As a result, it was an evident choice to
me to apply a gamepad as a means to control my tool. Several can be
plugged in at the same time on a computer, and they allow a variety of
input values, which are useful for moving items on a screen.
Consequently, I used two gamepads for the conception of this tool.
Concerning the bezier editor, one joystick of each controller is mapped
to control the anchor point of a bezier curve, whereas the second
joystick controls the magnet point of the curve. Then, a timer of ten
seconds sets off and is repeated in a loop: each time the timer reaches
0, the curve that is currently being edited stays in place, &quot;printed&quot;
on our canvas, and a new curve controlled by the users appears. The idea
for introducing a timer system was inspired by the video game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Smooth_Moves">WarioWare</a>, and
aims at enhancing verbal communication between the users, which proves
to be necessary in a fast-paced drawing context. It is also intended as
an experiment investigating how this time and drawing constraint can
potentially produce interesting shapes, similar to applications
demonstrated here <a href="https://constraint.systems/">Constraint Systems</a>. The
minimalist grid-based aesthetic was inspired by the image processing
tool <a href="https://100r.co/site/ronin.html">Ronin</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/hugo_bezier1.png" alt="hugo_bezier1.png"></p>
<figcaption><i>Graphic Jam</i> shape editor</figcaption>

<p><strong>Bitmap editor:</strong> Further pursuing these synchronous local experiments,
I created a simple bitmap editor. It allows copying and pasting specific
parts of a picture. Each user can control a cursor on the canvas,
defining an area which can then be copied with the triggers, moved
around, resized, and pasted. After conceiving these two tools, it was
necessary to assemble and place them into a fitting framework. Once
merged, shapes drawn with bezier curves can be pasted on images with two
blending modes. I realized throughout the project that I found the
aspect of being able to generate quick visuals and posters to be even
more interesting than creating independent graphic tools, which is why I
decided to lose the timer after all. However, I added a button to
&quot;print&quot; the curves more freely. Additionally, I added further
parameters for altering the curves, such as the stroke cap shape, the
width, color and saturation of the curve.</p>
<p><img src="img/hugo_bitmap3.png" alt="hugo_bitmap3.png"></p>
<figcaption><i>Graphic Jam</i> bitmap editor</figcaption>

<p><strong>Font editor:</strong> The final tool I added to my poster generator was a
font editor. It has two modes: a writing mode, allowing to input text,
and a deformation mode. The deformation mode works by cutting the text
in small parts and rearranging them on a grid. Users can then modify the
size of the grid, the type and strength of the deformation, switch
between different fonts, and duplicate a non-deformed layer of the text.
By quickly switching though and playing with the parameters, variations
on the base font can be generated. Alternatively, a nonreadable texture
may be generated which can be blended in the bitmap mode.</p>

<p>Local mode real-time collaboration.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-i-came-up-with-this-idea-3">How did I came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>The origin of this project is the observation that nowadays, most of the
digital design propositions for collaboration focus on remote
collaboration. This is true for productivity softwares, but also in the
field of videogames. Most games propose many features in an online
multiplayer context, but often no local mode. However, I have some very
fond memories of playing video games with friends on a video game
device. During these occasions, a special connection is built between
players, as they act together on the gaming device and turning the
computer into a social machine that brings people together. The project
I have been working on aims at bringing these special moments back into
our contemporary relationship with computers, and in this case within
the context of graphic design processes.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-of-this-step">Conclusion of this step</h3>
<p>The post-workshop ideas quickly evolved into more concrete projects,
sometimes very specific, as devices, plugins, applications, or more
experimental proposals. It is interesting to notice that each of them
integrated the specificities of our pedagogical programs both into their proposals and by the way they were presented. It was also a way to introduce ourselves through projects. This important step in the project allowed us to build the foundations of a sustained and solid
collaboration, a common ground, to pursue our work.</p>
<p>We had underestimated the importance of a longer preparation in situ,
with people and without communication apps but the pandemic was still
there, and we did as we were allowed to under the circumstances. </p>
<p>We anticipated the necessity to document everything, to produce a lot of texts and images that would allow us later to come back on the multiple evolutions of our work together and to learn from it.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the project, we knew that it was necessary to have
a theoretical perspective from researchers and practitioners involved in
the subjects that will occupy us for two years. The lecturers we invited
in Esadse to give conferences in the framework of DTCC, were chosen to
give students aside perspectives on the subject of tools for
collaboration, in and out of the creative field. As inter-disciplinary
projects are more and more common whether in schools or in the
professional world, we thought it would be interesting to question the
digital tools others are using for collaboration. We also chose all
these lecturers for their critical approach on tools and the numerous
issues raised by digital technologies, in line with our pedagogy.</p>
<p>We first invited Vincent Hugoo, to enlighten us on the survey, from a
sociological perspective, to understand how we could borrow some
methodological tools to enrich our preliminary explorations.</p>
<p>The work of Tallulah Frappier imposed itself by questioning the
governance and the political dimension of exchange as a democratic act
on web platforms.</p>
<p>In the continuity, we invited Angie Gaudion, who represents Framasoft,
an association famous for its involvement in the production and
distribution of free software.</p>
<p>We set aside the practice in interaction design, to focus on different
perspectives, and to finish this theoretical cycle, we chose to invite
Sarah Garcin, an important creator of the French scene in the field of
graphic design and digital practices.</p>

<p>Debate plays a major role in many theories of democracy: it is the basis
of all legitimate decisions. As an oratory practice and an exchange of
ideas between several people, one might think that debate depends only
on the individuals who lead it. However, from the agora to the internet
forum, the debate is regularly accompanied by materialities and
procedures that concretize the explicit and implicit rules that
structure it. It becomes a propitious subject for the designer&#39;s
reflection who is able to ask himself how these objects linked to the
debate reveal and condition it.</p>

<p>Over the past twenty years, advancements in technology have made remote
work easily accessible. Writing texts, discussing ideas, and
collaborating on projects with multiple individuals remotely has become
a common practice. It is now routine to work with colleagues, clients,
service providers, friends, and collaborators, even without ever meeting
them in person. While this conference acknowledges the well-known
phenomenon of remote collaboration, its focus is on introducing
experimental tools that enable collaboration in the same physical space
and in real-time.</p>

        <h1 id="encounter-between-different-approaches-to-digital-art-and-design-pedagogies">Encounter between Different Approaches to Digital Art and Design Pedagogies</h1>
<p>As stated before, despite being in the same disciplinary field, we have
noticed significant variations in our conceptions of design and working
methodologies. Additionally, our pedagogical approaches differ, as
evident from the feedback received during the first workshop and student
discussions.</p>
<p>We thought it was essential as we contemplated proposing a shared vision
of digital pedagogy, to assemble the following three texts. Our
intention was to provide an opportunity for every school representative
to express their perspectives, facilitating a deeper understanding of
our differences, which have played a crucial role in this project.
Additionally, we aimed to emphasize the aspects that unite us.</p>
<p>When collaborating on a project centered around the research object of
collaboration itself, our collective collaboration becomes a case study.
It is crucial not to overlook the differences of opinion and the
tensions they generate. Instead, we must utilize them to comprehend the
complexities inherent in collaborations that transcend individual
perspectives. Throughout our journey, we have consistently observed that
we were looking in different directions. This, perhaps, is the strength
of our project; it explores divergent viewpoints that coexist within
the design world but rarely intersect.</p>
<p>In addition to the three actors involved in this reflection on teaching
digital art and design practices (ESADSE, EKA, and HfG), ESADSE took the
initiative to organize openschool.art meetings to foster a broader
discussion at the national level in France. These meetings, held on the
10th and 11th of May 2022, brought together approximately thirty
teachers and students from various art and design schools across the
country at ESADSE. Building upon this momentum, we envision cultivating
ongoing dialogue and exchanges by establishing an annual meeting,
initially at the local level and eventually expanding to a European
scale. The second edition of openschool.art was successfully held at
ENSAD Paris in March 2023.</p>

<p>Each year, we select twelve people to study at IxDma. The international
program provides an opportunity for students to obtain a master&#39;s degree
in interaction design without prior design-related education or
experience. Instead, the program welcomes professionals from various
fields who are interested in pursuing a career in interaction design.
The program&#39;s emphasis on diversity is crucial in creating a dynamic
and vibrant learning environment where students can learn from each
other&#39;s unique perspectives and experiences. The program recognizes
that interaction design can benefit from a range of perspectives and
insights, and therefore values a diverse selection of students.</p>
<p>The study curriculum spans four semesters, with a total duration of two
years. The breakdown of the curriculum is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>The first semester focuses on building empathy, a core skill for designers. Students are taught to understand human behavior, values, and attitudes while learning to conduct user research and identify design opportunities. Subjects taught during this semester include Introduction to Interaction Design, Service Design, Visual Interaction Design, Design Storytelling, and Design Anthropology. </li>
<li>The second semester focuses on interactions with technology. Students are taught to build and develop ideas by making them tangible and actionable. They learn to prototype, test, and iterate their designs. Subjects covered include Tangible Interactions, Design for Digital Innovation, Emotional Design, Practical Business Design, Digital Portfolio Development, and Design in the Changing World. </li>
<li>The third semester centers around reflection and forward-thinking. Students are taught to consider the broader impact of their designs beyond human needs, and to adopt a critical mindset in their design projects. Subjects taught during this semester include Design for Social Innovation, Design for Emerging Themes, Immersive Experiences, Facilitation, Speculative Design, and Psychology for Designers. </li>
<li>The focus of fourth semester is to refine and develope expertise in the student&#39;s chosen area of specialization. Students are asked to prove their maturity as a professional and to enhance their portfolios. Subjects covered during this semester include Degree Project, Doing Research in Design, TASE Exhibition (a showcase of the
degree projects alongside other departments&#39; works at EKA&#39;s annual
end-of-year exhibition).</li>
</ul>
<p>The program&#39;s focus on sustainable, accessible, inclusive, and
conscious products, services, and experiences that reflects the current
trends in the design world. Many companies and organizations are now
prioritizing these factors in their design processes, recognizing the
need to create products and services that meet the needs of a diverse
and conscious user base. The curriculum supports students to understand
human behavior, values, and attitudes. By focusing on the human-centered approach, students are taught to build empathy, conduct user research, and develop their understanding of human needs. Students learn to adapt to the constantly evolving world while focusing on humans, technology, and environment.</p>
<p>The IxD program at EKA recognizes that the designer&#39;s job description
is constantly evolving. Therefore, it focuses on developing the core
attributes of a designer, including the right mindset, skillset, and
toolset. A designer&#39;s personality is critical in shaping their approach
to problem-solving. Therefore, the program encourages students to be
curious, experimental, and open to failure. They learn to be critical,
creative, and meticulous in their designs. The program also instills
values of humility, care, and responsibility towards the planet and its
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Human-centered design is no longer enough. The IxD program at EKA
recognizes that to create a positive future, we must look beyond human
needs when designing relationships between humans and technology. The
program encourages students to consider the impact of their designs on
the planet and its inhabitants. Interaction designers have the power to
shape human perception, values, and behaviors. The program emphasizes
the need to create designs that have a positive impact on the planet.</p>
<p>The IxD program at EKA is experiential and studio based. Students
develop their designer intuition, experience, and portfolio through
constant iteration, guided by passionate mentors who bring their
experience to guide students through challenging projects. The program
is structured around four semesters, each focusing on a different aspect
of interaction design.</p>
<p>IxDma is a well-established program that has been providing students
with high-quality education and training in interaction design for
several years. Over the years, the program has undergone continuous
development, with feedback from students and reflections from mentors,
making it more innovative and responsive to the changing needs of the
industry. The program is committed to providing students with the skills
and knowledge they need to succeed in the field of interaction design.
To achieve this, the program employs a variety of teaching methods that
focus on real-world experience and collaboration with professionals in
the industry.</p>
<p>One of the unique features of IxDma is its use of external mentors from
a wide range of industries. These mentors are experts in their
respective fields and provide valuable insights into the current trends
and practices in the world of interaction design. The program believes
that mentorship is a critical aspect of education, and by having
external mentors, students can gain a broader perspective on the
industry and its challenges. In addition to external mentors, IxDma
partners with renowned companies to provide real-life work experience
for students. The program engages with these companies and makes them
clients for every project, enabling students to work with actual
companies and experience a real-life working environment. This approach
not only provides students with practical experience but also helps them
develop their skills on how to collaborate with others in a professional
setting.</p>
<p>Moreover, IxDma believes that education should be innovative and respond

        <h2 id="design-pedagogy-in-hfg-schwäbisch-gmünd">Design Pedagogy in HfG, Schwäbisch-Gmünd</h2>
<p><em>&quot;Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.&quot;</em> (Malcolm X, 1964)</p>
<h3 id="brief-history">Brief History</h3>
<p>The roots of the university go back to 1776 when the first predecessor
institution, a drawing school, was founded. In 1860, it was transformed
into a royal college for the then important precious metal industry in
Schwäbisch Gmünd. The influences of the Bauhaus and the Ulm School of
Design (Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm) are formative both in structure
and orientation for the general teaching approach at the Schwäbisch
Gmünd School of Design.</p>
<p>In 1972, the &quot;University of Applied Sciences for Design&quot;
(Fachhochschule für Gestaltung), today known as the School of Design
(Hochschule für Gestaltung, or HfG), was established. Prof. Karl
Dittert, as the founding rector, aligned both the name and the
educational concept of the institution, which had previously been
artistically oriented, with the design principles of the Ulm School of
Design. In 2004, bachelor and master programs were introduced as part of
the European Bologna Process, which also resulted in the transformation
of the elective option &quot;Media Design&quot; in the visual communication
program into the BA program &quot;Interaction Design&quot; in 2007. This was the
first program of its kind in Germany. The emphasis on technological
developments also led to the establishment of the fourth BA Program
&quot;Internet of Things Design of Networked Systems,&quot; which has now
been renamed &quot;Digital Product Development&quot; since 2014.</p>
<p>Today, the university has around 750 students enrolled in five design
programs located on a relatively small campus with five locations. The
most notable location is the historical art nouveau building from 1909,
which previously housed the royal drawing school. The university is the
smallest in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg and exclusively
offers design study programs. It admits approximately 230 students each
year into its bachelor programs. These programs are primarily
project-oriented and taught in small student groups of around 15 to 20
students per course.</p>
<h3 id="bauhaus-ulm-school-of-design">Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design</h3>
<p>The dynamism and creative power of HfG stem from maintaining a delicate
balance between current scientific, social, and economic developments
and the continuous tradition that underlies the university. This
tradition is deeply influenced by the teaching methodologies of the
Bauhaus and, in particular, the Ulm School of Design. The founders of
the Bauhaus responded to a profound societal and cultural change brought
about by industrialization, which transformed everyday lives on an
unprecedented scale. They believed that in the pursuit of productivity,
we had lost touch with art, humanity, and nature. The Bauhaus sought to
rectify this by translating mere objects into artistic creations that
fostered more human connections. They emphasized the interconnectedness
of form and function, teaching that both aspects are integral to design.</p>
<p>After the atrocities of World War II, the founders of the Ulm School of
Design (HfG Ulm) strongly believed that design, as a rational approach
to problem-solving rather than solely artistic expression, was necessary
to address the humanitarian, political, and factual devastations caused
by the war. They recognized that design could have a positive impact on
society. The Ulm School of Design, along with the Bauhaus, played a
pivotal role in transferring methodologies from the sciences to design,
introducing system thinking and emphasizing sustainability. Ulm
represented a paradigm shift for design in Europe. Both institutions,
especially Ulm, continue to influence the direction of design education
in Schwäbisch Gmünd and reflect HfG&#39;s steadfast belief in the
transformative power of education and the importance of preparing
students for future challenges.</p>
<p>A century after the Bauhaus, industrialization has given way to
digitization, profoundly impacting everyday lives. Design has moved
beyond tangible objects to encompass intangible elements. It now
encompasses not only the physical products we create and use but also
their interfaces, logic, social implications, and societal impact. The
ecological consequences of mass production remain a pressing concern,
and design is now also involved in mass-producing emotions at an
unprecedented scale. Design shapes digital experiences that reach
millions of people, engaging and eliciting reactions. Manufacturing
these experiences has a profound effect on society, offering vast
opportunities to empower, connect, motivate, and enlighten. However,
like all technologies, it can also have unintended consequences that
create harm, isolation, fear, and doubt. Design now extends into
behavioral science, as designers have the ability to influence these
experiences and, therefore, society and humanity at a large scale.</p>
<h3 id="design-as-interconnected-discipline">Design as interconnected discipline</h3>
<p>HfG holds a deep-rooted belief that design, as a discipline, encompasses
scientific, social, and technical aspects and should actively contribute
to shaping cultural, technical, and economic advancements in a
responsible and sustainable manner. Unlike many other design schools,
HfG intentionally diverges from placing excessive emphasis on artistic
or artisanal prerequisites in the teaching of design fundamentals.
Instead, all five study programs at HfG prioritize imparting scientific
knowledge and fostering rational decision-making skills to justify
design choices.</p>
<h3 id="systematic-basic-training">Systematic basic training</h3>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of HfG is its intensive and
interdisciplinary approach to fundamental training. This comprehensive
training establishes the foundation for the following specific
curricular model of the respective design programs, ensuring a
consistent quality of design studies. During this phase, students are
equipped with a reliable repertoire of methods, develop a sense of
formal aesthetics, and learn various techniques. They delve into the
principles governing surface and space, light and color, as well as time
and movement. </p>
<p>This systematic study of design fundamentals prepares
students for future design challenges and aims to enhance their
problem-solving competence.</p>
<p>The teaching concept at HfG is designed holistically, incorporating a
combination of coherent teaching programs, self-determined learning,
practical relevance, international orientation, and collaborations with
other institutions and, when appropriate, companies. The aim is to
foster curiosity, inquisitiveness, and methodical thinking among
students while also strengthening their social and intercultural skills.
HfG tries to encourage an open culture of discussion between students
and lecturers, creating an atmosphere of intellectual exchange and
exploration.</p>
<p>Following the initial three semesters of basic studies, students at HfG
have the opportunity to work on projects aligned with their individual
interests and passions. In addition to engaging in effective individual
case studies, all teaching programs emphasize the development of
solution-oriented principles to address identified problems. This
approach showcases the model character of the projects and serves as a
valuable demonstration for future design tasks.</p>
<p>HfG believes that critical-methodical thinking, theoretical backgrounds,
and practical skills are interconnected and essential for the growth and
development of well-rounded designers.</p>
<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>
<p>HfG places a strong emphasis on group projects rather than personal
projects, with a focus on developing solutions through the
identification and understanding of problems. The university prioritizes
rational decision-making over artistic exploration, while maintaining a
critical stance towards the influence of big tech and big money,
striving to strike a balance between the utilization of technology and
the ethical implications associated with it.</p>
<p>The pedagogic concept at HfG is rooted in the belief that design has the
potential to improve human living conditions, regardless of the scale or
scope of projects. This core belief drives the university&#39;s commitment
to responsible and impactful design practices.</p>
<h3 id="rationality">Rationality</h3>
<p>HfG recognizes the significance of scientific principles in design. By
integrating scientific, social, and technical aspects into the
curriculum, HfG adopts a rational and systematic approach to design
education. The university acknowledges that design is not solely an
artistic endeavor but a discipline that requires a comprehensive
understanding of underlying scientific foundations and technological
concepts. Through the imparting of scientific knowledge and the
promotion of rational decision-making, HfG aims to equip its students
with the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of the design
landscape.</p>
<h3 id="method-based-critical-thinking">Method-based critical thinking</h3>
<p>The teaching concept at HfG is designed to foster intellectual
curiosity, methodical thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
Students are encouraged to engage in critical discourse, explore
different perspectives, and challenge established norms. The open
culture of discussion with lecturers creates an environment that
nurtures intellectual growth and encourages students to develop their
own design philosophies.</p>
<h3 id="real-world-projects-to-address-real-world-problems">Real-world-projects to address real-world problems</h3>
<p>Through project-based learning, students at HfG gain hands-on experience
in tackling real-world design challenges. The emphasis on identifying
and understanding problems ensures that students develop a deep
understanding of user needs and societal contexts. By focusing on
solution-oriented design principles, students are empowered to create
innovative and meaningful solutions that address the pressing issues of
our time.</p>
<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>
<p>One distinctive program at HfG is the discipline of Interaction Design.
It positions itself at the intersection of design, psychology,
mechanical engineering, and computer science. HfG recognizes that
designing exceptional products requires not only a solid understanding
of design principles but also the ability to effectively communicate
with specialists from mechanical engineering and computer science.
Consequently, the Interaction Design program provides students with
insights into digital technology and programming, albeit only to the
extent necessary for the design process.</p>
<p>The curriculum of the Interaction Design program encompasses a wide
range of topics, including software interfaces, machine and device
controls, internet applications, information systems, and the
utilization of the latest technologies. The program goes beyond the
realm of developing mobile apps, as interaction designers are needed
wherever new digital technologies emerge. HfG acknowledges that
technology alone does not guarantee a successful product. Instead, it
emphasizes the importance of innovative ideas and coherent design in
creating useful applications that are both easy and enjoyable to use.
This user-centric approach is the overarching goal of the Interaction
Design program.</p>
<h3 id="design-contributing-to-society-pro-technology">Design contributing to society, pro technology</h3>
<p>HfG&#39;s approach to education is rooted in its belief in the
transformative power of design. The university recognizes the need for
responsible and sustainable design practices that contribute positively
to society. By instilling a critical stance towards the influence of big
tech and big money, HfG encourages students to consider the ethical
implications of their design decisions. The university strives to create
designers who are conscious of the social, cultural, and environmental
impact of their work, working towards bettering human living conditions in various domains.</p>

        <h2 id="teaching-digital-art-and-design-some-reflections-based-on-the-pedagogy-developed-in-esadse-saint-etienne-higher-school-of-art-and-design">Teaching Digital Art and Design: Some reflections based on the pedagogy developed in ESADSE (Saint-Etienne Higher School of Art and Design)</h2>
<p>From the 1980s onwards, adapting to the transformations of Western
society, certain French art schools have incorporated the question of
digital technology into their teachings. Firstly, through the
acquisition of technical equipment, typically dedicated to video and
graphic design, and then through the widespread adoption of &quot;computer
rooms&quot; which, particularly in the 1990s, allowed for the training of
entire classes on specific software while also providing access to the
Internet. This was followed by the establishment of &quot;digital hubs&quot;
designed to manage the educational computer infrastructure while also
providing opportunities for initiations, particularly in the field of
electronics. Then, around 2010, certain institutions, inspired by
fablabs, were equipped with tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters,
and various computer-controlled machines — which are still widely used
today — in addition to more &quot;digitally-based&quot; tools such as VR
headsets.</p>
<p>The integration of the digital world into art and design schools has
been accompanied by exceptional technical instruction, enabling students
to achieve mastery of the tools within the unique framework of
personalized pedagogy that characterizes art and design education.</p>
<p>However, in retrospect, it becomes evident that the formal and
theoretical approach to the digital world has not always been adequately
addressed during these decades, creating a significant bias in the
education provided by French art schools. This bias involves considering
the digital domain solely from a technical perspective, regarding it
merely as a tool serving traditional practices without fundamentally
questioning the transformative changes it entails. The new means of
expression, along with the conceptual, aesthetic, performative,
cultural, societal, and political aspects associated with them, have
often been neglected, if not hindered or overshadowed by a necessary but
limiting technical learning process. This technical focus, while
essential, fails to fully represent the entirety of the challenges
presented by digital creation.</p>
<p>However, this criticism should be approached with greater nuance and
subtlety. It is known that art schools are shaped by the trends driven
by successive management and teaching teams. Digital &quot;moments&quot; have
indeed emerged in certain institutions, only to fade away due to changes
in direction. The recent initiative Openschool.art (note or reference),
which invites &quot;digital&quot; teachers in art schools to share the diversity
of their practices during regular meetings, demonstrates that the
&quot;digital&quot; domain, while acknowledged and integrated into contemporary
practices from a technical standpoint, still needs to prove or reaffirm
its legitimacy as a &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;artistic language&quot; despite decades
of existence.</p>
<p>ESAD Saint-Étienne is one of the institutions that have succeeded in
consistently integrating a digital &quot;mindset,&quot; which has evolved over
time but remains persistent. The recent establishment of the &quot;Digital
Creation&quot; program highlights the distinctiveness of digital expression,
setting it apart from more traditional conceptual approaches in design
and art. The objective is to educate creators who go beyond being mere
users of tools and become conscious actors aware of the possibilities
offered by digital technology, while also taking into account the
societal and environmental implications inherent in such productions.</p>
<p>However, this essential objective, once stated, does not provide a
singular path to follow. The paths to achieve this goal are numerous and
marked by numerous questions. During the first session of the
Openschool.art meetings, we compiled a list of questions to fuel
discussions. Without reproducing them in their entirety here, these
lines of inquiry form a problematic foundation that remains relevant at
the time of writing this text. The fundamental questions can be
summarized as follows: Are there specific elements inherent to digital
creation? Does declaring oneself as a &quot;digital artist&quot; or &quot;digital
designer&quot; hold any significance?</p>
<p>And if we develop it further:
What are the &quot;best practices&quot; in digital technology that should be
taught to art and design students? Is there an essential digital
cultural background to transmit? Does teaching digital design go hand in
hand with teaching specific tools? Does using software or digital
production tools (such as laser cutting or 3D printing) in a project
make it a digital project? Can original and creative work be created
using proprietary software? Is peer learning the most effective method
for mastering digital tools? Can digital creation training be devolved
to tutorials?</p>
<p>Amidst this array of questions, we can identify inquiries related to the
transmission of knowledge (practical, cultural, methodological), the
relevance of learning tools, and the renewal of pedagogical techniques.
Without aiming to provide definitive answers in the following lines, we
will simply attempt to shed light on certain points based on acquired
experience and current observations. After briefly recalling the
specific teaching context at ESADSE, we will clarify the chosen position
within the &quot;Digital Creation&quot; program — namely, an approach focused on
&quot;creation&quot; — and then emphasize the importance of advocating for a
distinct &quot;writing&quot; as a key element of contemporary digital creation.</p>
<h3 id="context-of-digital-education-at-esad-saint-etienne">Context of Digital Education at ESAD Saint-Etienne</h3>
<p>Starting from the 1980s, technical courses as well as artistic and
theoretical teachings have established a &quot;digital culture&quot; within ESAD
Saint-Étienne. As early as 1982, artist Gilles Roussi, later joined by
economist Yann Moulier-Boutang, spread the FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open
Source Software) culture within the institution, supporting, among other
things, the creation of a student association called &quot;Le Garage,&quot;
which became a pioneering hub for debates and initiatives in the field
of &quot;open-source&quot;. In 2008, the arrival of designer François Brument
within the school sparked a new dynamic around digital design and
parametric design, which is still carried by the current team. In 2010,
the establishment of the Random() laboratory, which enables the
development of experimental digital projects and provides post-master
level opportunities for students, contributed to integrating research
aspects into the digital creation challenges of the institution. At a
later stage, Random() was associated with the Labo NRV of ENSBA Lyon
through a partnership agreement to create the Digital Research Unit in
Art and Design of ESADSE-ENSBA Lyon (a research laboratory that we
unfortunately don&#39;t have enough space to describe in detail here).</p>
<p>In 2014, the introduction of the &quot;Media&quot; department (graphic design
and digital) within the Design master&#39;s program at ESADSE was another
milestone. It was replaced in 2021 by two departments, one of which is
titled &quot;Digital Creation&quot; (an autonomous syllabus separated from
graphic design with the intention of being open to all forms of
practice, including artistic). This transformation clearly demonstrates
the the institution&#39;s commitment to digital practices as inherent to
contemporary art and design.</p>
<p>In terms of the &quot;Digital Creation&quot; department, and the the Random()
lab rely on a permanent team capable of addressing technical,
methodological, artistic, and theoretical questions. The team includes
Damien Bais, François Brument, Jérémie Nuel, Jacques-Daniel Pillon, and
Lucile Schrenzel. They are supported by a technician responsible for
machine maintenance, Samantha Zannoni (Smaïl Khellouf until september 2023). The department and the lab have
access to the resources of school&#39;s digital department as well as their
own equipment. The machinery is designed to provide a range of diverse
tools, including 3D printing (including ceramic printing), laser
cutting, plotters, robotic arms, and more. It also involves interfaces
such as electronic prototyping platforms, various sensors, VR headsets,
graphic tablets, and exhibition devices such as screens, projectors, and
the MireOS software.</p>
<h3 id="the-creation-oriented-approach-of-the-digital-creation-department">The &quot;creation-oriented&quot; approach of the &quot;Digital Creation&quot; department</h3>
<p>Approaching the digital world as a space for &quot;creation&quot; is not a
principled stance. It is a way to specify, and thus distinguish, an
approach to art and/or design creation from fields such as innovation,
engineering, &quot;industrial&quot; design, R&amp;D, and numerous forms of
digital-related creativity. Indeed, our position as an art school
implies an approach that deviates from the aforementioned logics and
instead encourages practices that invite reflection, critique, and
experimentation. The skills we provide to our students do not correspond
to a specific profession within the digital field, but rather to a
different way of approaching it, one that goes beyond the ideological
prism often associated with the GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon,
Microsoft). In opposition to this ideology, we offer a thinking and an
imaginary that allow us to break free from the solutionist tunnel and
ideally lead to unique creations that are positioned with accuracy.</p>
<p>Hereof, one could say that the idea takes precedence over the project.
Throughout the design process, it is the idea that guides the project
and evolves towards its realization, ultimately leading to the creation
of mock-ups, prototypes, or finished works accompanied by their
technical solutions. However, it may also result in an incomplete
outcome if the design reveals significant problems and deadlocks
(technical, ecological, or ethical). Choosing to abandon a project, as
long as it is justified, can indeed be the best response to a given
issue, especially in the present time, and holds equal pedagogical value
to the skills acquired through a &quot;finished&quot; project.</p>
<p>In this sense, the &quot;creation-based&quot; approach clearly questions
production through massive automation and standardization, as well as
the normalization of creative forms primarily derived from major names
of contemporary digital world.</p>
<p>This positioning is therefore based on several guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not training for a specific profession in response to market
trends, but rather cultivating a profile of an artist and/or
designer with expertise in digital approaches to creation.</strong> These
young professionals do not simply have a &quot;digital touch&quot; within a
more traditional practice; they are expected to navigate fluidly
within the ever-changing transformations of the digital world. In
this regard, it is more about their understanding of processes,
transformations, and potentials rather than simply adhering to a
specific technical platform. This approach to digital practice can
be only attainable at the level of Master&#39;s degree (5 years of
education), considering the fact that the digital landscape at the
beginning of a student&#39;s first year is vastly different from what
they will encounter upon graduation (the current explosion of AI
being just one example). This kind of digital creator profile
naturally goes hand in hand with the ability to work collaboratively
or cooperatively.</li>
<li><strong>In certain cases, adopting the position of a &quot;digital artisan&quot; is
equal to a design approach that opposes standardized production.</strong>
Digital technology, enabled by programming, parametric design, and
other tools, makes case-by-case creation possible. The digital
artisan exercises control over adaptation and variations within a
&quot;computer workshop&quot;, utilizing their expertise to make precise
adjustments based on specific requirements. This proficiency, in
order to go beyond mere virtuosity, is accompanied by conceptual and
formal reinvention for each project.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating environmental impact into education.</strong> Recycling,
reusing, repairing, and considering electronic pollution throughout
the production process are subjects that need to be taken into
account. Moreover, in a logic of &quot;best practices,&quot; digital
technology allows us to do less (reducing quantities compared to
industrial production), and adapt to specific needs while minimizing
the use of physical or &quot;dematerialized&quot; materials. In other words,
while digital technology facilitates abundance (of images, diverse
products, storage medium, etc.), if used in an economical and
thoughtful manner, it can also optimize the limitation of the
ecological impact of a project.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage students to use FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source
Software) tools such as Blender and Godot as an alternative is not
merely an economic choice.</strong> Unlike proprietary software, these
open-source tools are the result of co-designing within the user
community. With a certain level of programming proficiency, these
tools can even be directly modified. This shows students that
software is not something stagnant but it can be adapted and
reconfigured according to their needs. This initial step leads to
greater autonomy, which can even extend to creating one&#39;s own
tools. Certainly, this freedom requires learning how to code, but
this investment makes the difference between being a user of digital
tools and being a digital creator. The goal is not to turn the
student into a developer, but to provide them with the necessary
tools to gain greater freedom in manipulating digital materials. The
&quot;creation-based&quot; approach shifts the current focus of digital
technology, allowing for critical distance and a certain autonomy in
practice, which is conducive to the development of original
creators. However, this educational framework also aims to enhance
the student&#39;s ability to develop their own &quot;digital expression&quot;
or &quot;digital language.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-does-digital-writing-mean">What does &quot;digital writing&quot; mean?</h3>
<p>Since the 1960s and the irruption of computing in the field of art,
creators and theorists have identified specific characteristics of the
digital world: information discretization/sampling, the ability for
repetition with variations (permutations) unlike mechanical reproduction
systems, hybridization functions, plasticity leading to &quot;hypermedia,&quot;
interactivity, generativity, and more. These characteristics highlight
the unique qualities of the digital medium and its potential for
artistic expression and exploration.</p>
<p>These different elements make the digital medium unique and distinctive.
The concept of &quot;digital expression&quot; aims to describe an approach in
art or design that specifically utilizes the inherent possibilities of
the digital world, as opposed to other practices that use it primarily
as productivity tools. Developing a &quot;digital expression&quot; requires an
understanding that behind every action performed by a computer, there is
code, variables, hardware, and more. It entails adopting a mindset
grounded in the flexibility, impermanence, and constraints of the
digital medium.</p>
<p>To be able to guide the students along this path, autonomy is emphasized
during the learning process. Guided by regular support from teachers,
progress is shaped as projects flourish, rather than being dictated by
hardware and software updates. By developing the ability to cultivate
creative projects that leverage the advantages of digital technology
without seeing them as limitations, students acquire more than just
technical skills that may become obsolete. Instead, they cultivate an
aptitude for seizing opportunities and preparing for the ever-changing
landscape of the digital world.</p>
<p>This ability to perceive the focus of a concept or technique within a
specific context is also acquired though knowledge of art and design
history. This allows for the integration of digital technology into a
broader &quot;history of forms&quot; — one that extends far beyond the major
players of the contemporary digital world and mostly representing
Western perspectives but also those from other cultural contexts.
Without becoming overwhelming, these references allow us to understand
why, for instance, virtuality and AI have reached their current state
and how these techniques have already been the subject of projects and
artworks that have sparked waves of questioning and critique. This
knowledge prevents a naive approach and allows for a critical distance
from the dazzling promises and technical effects produced by the
competition for &quot;innovation,&quot; placing creation and its demands at the
heart of concerns. This cultural acquisition work, in addition to
nurturing sensitivity, is also accompanied by attention to — and even
involvement in — societal and political domains.</p>
<p>During the course of their education years at ESADSE, students can
encounter and experiment with various classes and workshops, including
programming as a tool for artistic research, parametric design,
interaction (installation, virtual spaces, video games, etc.), digital
fabrication, graphic design, digital publishing and web design, live
coding and digital performance, working with data and AI, methodology
and workflow for digital projects (including the documentation process),
and more. This broad foundation opens up possibilities for diverse
digital experiences and, in turn, nourishes an artistic practice that,
in addition to its specific characteristics, also seeks to foster the
uniqueness of each student. The goal is for students to develop their
own digital artistic expression, not conceived as a predetermined formal
or conceptual framework, but rather as an extension of contemporary
issues to be shared freely.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With &quot;Digital Creation&quot; department and the Digital Research Unit of
ESADSE-ENSBA Lyon, ESADSE covers various aspects of digital technology
throughout its curriculum, from the first to the eighth year, ranging
from introductory to specialized levels and even research-oriented
programs. This pedagogical program enables comprehensive training in
accordance with the orientations described in this text, namely the
&quot;creation-oriented&quot; approach and the assertion of a &quot;digital artistic
expression.&quot; These two points, as developed here, do not address the
entirety of the initial problematic nor encompass all aspects of digital
education at our school.</p>
<p>The aim of this text, as understood, is not to present ESADSE as an
exemplary model to follow or to impose our approach to various
questionings. The intention is rather to testify — without the desire to
generalize — to a pedagogical experience that seeks to articulate the
field of creative arts with the digital world, addressing its
challenges, particularly in a context where producing less — or even not
at all, in order to preserve the environment — is a fundamental issue.</p>
<p>Thinking and rethinking the formal and conceptual aspects of digital
technology in art and design is a task that can never be completed but
remains fascinating to study, share, and transmit.</p>

<p>Becoming an artist or a designer in a rapidly evolving digital society
requires adaptability and a deep understanding of its dynamics. How can
we navigate a world that is strongly influenced by human actions? How do
we reinvent or preserve practices and tools that contribute to a
brighter future instead of overshadowing it? Maintaining a critical
distance while creating at the speed of the digital world is essential.
Furthermore, how do we effectively transmit our ideas amidst the
constant flux of new stimuli? These fundamental questions resonate with
many creative institutions, and openschool.art provides a unique
opportunity to address them by bringing together various art schools and
universities.</p>
<p>On the 10th and 11th of May 2022, approximately fifty teachers and
students from French art and design schools gathered in ESADSE&#39;s
auditorium to discuss the challenges involved in teaching digital
creative practices.</p>

<h4 id="biennale-internationale-design-saint-etienne-2022">Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne 2022</h4>
<p>Since our event coincided with BID Saint-Etienne, we had the opportunity
to showcase openschool.art as part of the <em>Le monde, sinon rien</em> (The
world or nothing) exhibition, which featured projects from students and
young researchers representing five French art and design institutions.</p>
<p>The exhibition served as an extensive experimental platform open for public participation. Upon entering the exhibition, visitors encountered a large floor map representing a realm of exploration; the very landscape that art and design school teachers offer their students each year, which they traverse, document, and transform.</p>
<p>Curated by Sophie Pène (lecturer-researcher at the Learning Planet
Institute) and Benjamin Graindorge (designer and lecturer at ESADSE),
the exhibition dedicated a space to openschool.art, both physically
within the exhibition and on the website.</p>
<p><img src="img/lmsr_capture.jpg" alt="lmsr_capture.jpg"></p>
<figcaption><i>openschool.art</i> page on the <i>Le Monde Sinon Rien</i> exhibtion website</figcaption>

<p>We decided to showcase the questions that were discussed during the
professional meetings, alongside videos that were inspired by those
questions and produced by some of the participating schools. Throughout
the entire Biennale, videos and displays were continuously added as the
ideas and discussions evolved.</p>

<h4 id="20-21-march-ensad-paris">20-21 March, ENSAD (Paris)</h4>
<p>The latest openschool.art session took place in Issy-les-Moulineaux,
hosted by ENSAD Paris. It served as an open forum for digital educators
from French art schools and universities to engage in discussions on a
wide range of issues. During this session, participants focused on three
main themes: &quot;The impact of AI on art and schools,&quot; &quot;Exploring
alternatives to Adobe: common tools for schools and resource sharing,&quot;
and &quot;Exploring digital tools through collective practice&quot;.</p>
<p>One question that remains unanswered is the role of students, which
needs to be reconsidered. In this regard, a compelling proposal would be
to consolidate the financial resources allocated to the event, allowing
for the inclusion of students with diverse profiles and backgrounds.
This approach is crucial in ensuring a diverse range of thoughts and
practices around the table.</p>

    </div>

        <h1 id="learning-to-collaborate-with-different-perspectives">Learning to collaborate with different perspectives</h1>
<p>Collaboration is rarely a seamless and effortless process; rather, it
requires negotiation and a willingness to learn and work together.
Establishing a productive group dynamic and finding common ground that
extends beyond mere consensus often demands patience, empathy, effective
communication, and open-mindedness. Indeed, collaborating with
individuals who hold diverse perspectives can present significant
challenges. People from different disciplines, cultures, or backgrounds
often bring contrasting approaches, values, and ways of thinking and
working to the table. While these differences are valuable for
generating new ideas and undertaking ambitious projects, they can also
give rise to misunderstandings, conflicts, and communication barriers
within a team.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art/methodologies-and-tools-for-collaboration/2-1/">the first workshop in EKA</a>, our collaboration was definitely not
easy since we had very different working methods and expectations. As
Ludwig Kannicht aptly remarked after this workshop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first workshop was an incredibly valuable experience, despite
the challenges we faced. It was a learning journey, even if we had to
overcome some difficulties along the way. Looking back, I realize that
we had diverse cultures and understandings of design. If given the
opportunity to repeat the workshop, I would prioritize addressing these
differences from the start. Allocating dedicated time for open
discussions and understanding each other&#39;s perspectives would be
crucial. It takes time to bridge the gap when collaborating with
individuals from different contexts. Expecting seamless collaboration
from day one is unrealistic.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>

<p>After the initial workshop, we proceeded to <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art/Learning-to-collaborate-with-different-perspectives/4-1/">the second one held in
Esadse</a>, Saint-Etienne in April 2021. For this workshop, we opted for a
more flexible approach, where no specific methods or tools were imposed
or even suggested. The aim was to provide students with the freedom to
experiment and discover their own ways of collaborating, culminating in
the creation of a playable game by the end of the week. The students
were tasked with familiarizing themselves with one another and
leveraging their individual perspectives and skills within small group
settings. Additionally, this week-long workshop provided an excellent
opportunity to explore the nuances between collaboration, cooperation,
contribution, and participation within diverse group dynamics.</p>
<p>During the final DTCC workshop week at HfG, Ludwig led a workshop titled
Radical Collaboration, which specifically focused on collaboration dynamics from a psychological perspective.
In this workshop, he encouraged the students examine and analyze some collaborative moments
where they encountered obstacles that led to tensions, in order to
better understand what happened and learn how to effectively respond and
navigate similar challenges in the future.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will revisit these two workshops, recognizing them
as key moments in our collective journey of learning how to collaborate
effectively.</p>
<p>We will then feature interviews with students who participated in these
workshops, offering valuable insights into their experiences and the
lessons they learned within the collaborative context of three European
schools. These workshops not only exposed them to alternative approaches
to design but also introduced them to different school cultures,
methods, and tools that diverged from their usual practices.
Furthermore, the workshops prompted a profound self-reflection,
encouraging students to question their own practices and attitudes in
relation to those of their peers.</p>

<p>In connection with the objectives of the Digital Tools for Creative
Collaboration project, the workshop aimed to provide an experiential
understanding of the fundamental principles underlying collaborative
work. Recognizing the challenges we faced during the initial workshop at
EKA, where we struggled to reconcile our diverse design visions and
methodologies, we believed that games, as a shared cultural artifact,
would serve as a suitable foundation for our exploration.</p>
<h3 id="subject-and-goals-of-the-workshop">Subject and goals of the workshop</h3>
<p>Considering that games (including board games, video games, sports
games, etc.) incorporate mechanisms that involve various forms of
collaboration, we decided to center the workshop around the concept of
collective play. While many games emphasize competition, only a few are
centered on collaboration and cooperation, allowing participants to work
together towards a shared victory instead of playing against each other.</p>
<p>During the workshop, we introduced two guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing games collaboratively in small groups.</li>
<li>Developing rules that encourage collaboration as a means to achieve
success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Esadse provided resources such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and VR
headsets to support the creation of prototypes that could be played on
the final day.</p>

<h4 id="talk-notions-about-cooperative-game">Talk: Notions about cooperative game</h4>
<p>As an introduction to the workshop, David-Olivier Lartigaud discussed
cooperative games, drawing upon references such as the book <em>Rules of
Play: Game Design Fundamentals</em> by Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric
Zimmerman (MIT Press, 2003), as well as other sources mentioned in the
text.</p>
<h4 id="conditions-for-a-game-to-exist">Conditions for a game to exist</h4>
<ul>
<li>Every game exists within a defined framework, encompassing a specific time and space, which communicates to players that they are engaged in a game.</li>
<li>The magic circle, a concept introduced by Johan Huizinga in his book &quot;Homo Ludens&quot; (1938), defines the space in which a game unfolds.
  Unlike informal play, which lacks clear boundaries, games establish
  a formalized structure that explicitly delineates the magic circle.</li>
<li>Within the magic circle, the game&#39;s rules create a special set of
meanings for the players of a game. These meanings guide the play of
the game.</li>
<li>As a system, a game can be considered to have an open or closed
relationship to its context. Considered as RULES, a game is closed.
Considered as PLAY, a game is both open and closed. Considered as
CULTURE, a game is open.</li>
<li>The lusory attitude refers to the state of mind necessary to engage
in gameplay. It entails a collective acceptance of the rules&#39;
constraints, driven by the enjoyment and satisfaction that games
offer.</li>
<li>Rules form the fundamental structure of games, defining the
parameters and interactions within which players operate.</li>
<li>Rules limit player action</li>
<li>Rules are explicit and unambiguous</li>
<li>Rules are shared by all players</li>
<li>Rules are fixed</li>
<li>Rules are binding</li>
<li>Rules are repeatable</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are games that challenge and deviate from these
characteristics, these traits represent the general attributes of game
rules when viewed strictly from a formal perspective.</p>
<h4 id="games-as-systems-of-conflict">Games as systems of conflict</h4>
<ul>
<li>How many players can participate in the game?</li>
<li>Is the gameplay simultaneous or turn-based?</li>
<li>Does the game include a high score list?</li>
<li>Do players receive continuous feedback on their relative scores?</li>
<li>Does the game provide opportunities for players to compare their
scores and game statistics?</li>
<li>Are there computer-generated opponents and obstacles that players
collectively face, or do the players compete against each other?</li>
<li>Does the game structure allow for direct conflicts between players?</li>
<li>Are there resources in the game that players can compete for?</li>
<li>Can players use money to continue playing or enhance their gameplay?</li>
</ul>
<p>Coopetition or co-opetition (sometimes spelled &quot;coopertition&quot; or
&quot;co-opertition&quot;) is a neologism coined to describe cooperative
competition. Coopetition is a portmanteau of cooperation and
competition. Basic principles of co-opetitive structures have been
described in game theory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition">(source: &quot;Coopetition,&quot; in Wikipedia)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="talk-how-to-make-a-collaborative-game">Talk: How to make a collaborative game?</h3>
<p>Mathias Hû, an Esadse student, presented his incomplete brand game
project: Run-off. The purpose of the presentation was to highlight the
issues and difficulties involved in creating a collaborative game. Here
are some key points discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>When designing a game for multiple players, it becomes crucial to
consider how they interact with each other.</li>
<li>The most common approach is through <strong>competitive</strong> gameplay, where
all players compete against each other to win. This can be seen in
games like Street Fighter, Risk (territorial conquest), or Mario
Kart (racing for first place).</li>
<li>Alternatively, players can be grouped into different teams,
introducing cooperative relationships within each team. While
competition still drives the game, it fosters collaboration.
Examples include team sports like basketball, multiplayer games like
Overwatch, or brand games like Time&#39;s Up.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<p>Finally, if you want to create a game that focuses solely on cooperation
without any competitive aspect between players, you need to provide a
new motivation for players to engage in the game. Competition is often
used because it easily attracts people to play and keeps them engaged.
However, there are alternatives to drive cooperative gameplay. Here is
an initial list of alternatives for the core concept of cooperative
games:</p>
<ul>
<li>The desire to <strong>create</strong> something together can be a sufficient
motivation. This is evident in certain Minecraft servers or
construction games like Lego or Kapla (although the latter two may
be more accurately classified as toys with the potential for
creating games).</li>
<li>In other cases, <strong>exploration</strong> serves as a driving force for player
engagement. This is observed in narrative, linear, or puzzle games.
The collective desire to uncover the next step, part of the story,
or environment motivates players to continue together. Examples
include games like Broforce or Portal 2 in cooperative mode, as well
as many role-playing games.</li>
<li><strong>The game itself can serve as the opponent</strong> for a collective team
of players. In this case, the game presents challenges that the team
must overcome or achieve the most desirable score.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these <em>motors</em> can be combined and many games use a combination
of them.</p>
<h4 id="run-off">Run-off</h4>
<p>Run-off is an incomplete brand game project that initially aimed to
create a competitive game but with a twist: adopting a non-cooperative
strategy proves to be counterproductive for all players involved. The
game begins with individual players pitted against each other, but as
the game progresses, teams gradually form, and collective strategies are
built. In the game, each player is responsible for managing a floor of
tubes in a tower. Rain falls on the top floor and runs off through each
subsequent floor until it reaches the ground. On the ground, each player
has a vase and must collect as much water as possible. However, without
collective coordination, the water is wasted for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="img/run-off.png" alt="run-off.png"></p>
<figcaption><i>Run-Off</i> game prototype by Mathias Hû</figcaption>


<h4 id="difficulties-and-conclusions">Difficulties and conclusions</h4>
<p>The game became too complex and required a high level of spatial
projection, which made it challenging to play. Additionally, certain
rules within the game system were unbalanced, further hindering its
playability. These various aspects ultimately rendered the game
unplayable.</p>
<p>This experience has significantly influenced my approach to game
creation. I believe it is crucial to start with a concept that is not
overly complex and focus on achieving a balanced and playable situation
initially, before adding additional features. Maintaining this balance
is delicate, so it is important to extensively test the game with each
rule change to ensure its preservation.</p>
<p>The use of metaphors or narratives can be highly beneficial when
introducing new rules or features, as they tap into our familiarity with
the concepts they represent. This familiarity makes it easier for
players to understand and apply these elements. In the case of Run-off,
the concept of gravity was utilized, allowing players to grasp the
intricate movement of water without the need for extensive explanation,
given their existing familiarity with the concept.</p>
<h3 id="shared-references-video-games">Shared references: Video games</h3>
<p>In some MMORPGs, such as those with Guild systems, players must join
forces and work together to conquer dungeons or defeat powerful enemies,
drawing inspiration from tabletop RPGs. Participants engage in
discussions, solve puzzles, and coordinate strategies to overcome
challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, many sandbox games offer cooperative or collaborative
modes. For example, in GTA, players can team up to carry out bank
heists, while Minecraft allows players to collaborate on building
projects. However, the gameplay of these games is not exclusively
focused on cooperation, as players can also pursue individual
activities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are games specifically designed to require
cooperation in order to complete or win.</p>
<p>Below are a few examples along with brief comments showcasing the
significance of collaboration in these games:</p>
<h4 id="it-takes-two--a-way-out">It Takes Two / A way out</h4>
<p>Two players must cooperate to complete tasks. It is the complementarity
and coordination of actions that counts.</p>
<h4 id="overcooked">Overcooked</h4>
<p>Working together to go fast. What is interesting is that everyone
redistributes tasks according to the situation in order to be as
efficient as possible.</p>
<h4 id="nvidia-omniverse">Nvidia omniverse</h4>
<p>Not a game but proceeds on the same principle. Everyone collaborates on
a specific task to obtain a quick result.</p>
<h4 id="among-us">Among Us</h4>
<p>In this game, there&#39;re tasks to be done with a common goal (just a
pretext), but the real goal is to find an imposter. Here&#39;s an
interesting disruptive element, like a bad collaborator. No
synchronization or coordination between actions necessarily. Everyone
does their own thing until it is time to discuss for eliminating a
player. It&#39;s a bit like some TV shows where several people in a loft
vote to eliminate a roommate. (In the case of Among US, which is
map-based, it is easy to imagine an adaptation in the form of a board or
a card game.)</p>
<h4 id="out-of-space">Out of Space</h4>
<p>It&#39;s a collocation game. You have to maintain a <em>space station</em>, avoid
dirt, have food, etc.</p>
<h4 id="keep-talking-and-nobody-explodes">Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes</h4>
<p>Collaboration when the players are not at the same level of information.</p>
<h4 id="alternate-reality-games-arg">Alternate Reality Games (ARG)</h4>
<p>ARG has the power to create communities searching together to solve a
riddle. The cooperation is active after the start of the game and not
before, as in many games. In this case, we can speak more about
contribution, which is a very specific type of cooperation.</p>
<h4 id="heave-ho">Heave-Ho</h4>
<p>This game is just a lot of fun! It also involves the exploration of a
collective movement created by the addition of individual movements.</p>
<h4 id="a-way-out">A Way Out</h4>
<p>A videogame created to be played in coop mode only.</p>
<h4 id="brothers--a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons</h4>
<p>This game offers you the possibility to control two characters with a
single controller. Although it is intended to be played by only one
person, it can easily be played by two. This creates a new relationship
with the controller as an individual object and introduces a new way to
play collectively.</p>
<h4 id="medieval-games">Medieval games</h4>
<p>This game for four players is released on Wii. It simulates a brand game
where each player competes against the others. In each round, all
players participate in a mini-game, and the winner(s) receive rewards
within the overall brand game. The mini-games create various collective
structures, including 1v1v1v1, 2v2, 1v3, and 1v1 with two players who
can assist or hinder one another. These dynamics create alliances and
implicit teams among the players.</p>
<h3 id="shared-references-board-games">Shared references: Board games</h3>
<h4 id="mafiathe-werewolves-of-millers-hollow">Mafia/The Werewolves of Millers Hollow</h4>
<p>Two sides engage in a collaborative competition where they silently
exchange information to strategize against each other.</p>
<h4 id="5-minute-dungeon">5-Minute Dungeon</h4>
<p>A very simple cooperative game!</p>
<h4 id="legend-of-andor">Legend of Andor</h4>
<p>A very complicated cooperative game!</p>
<h4 id="the-mind">The Mind</h4>
<p>It&#39;s a very simple board game where players must collaborate on a task
without the ability to communicate verbally. It presents an interesting
challenge of how to achieve a goal with a significant constraint.</p>
<h4 id="mansion-of-madness---2nd-edition">Mansion of madness - 2nd edition</h4>
<p>The game master is a tablet that provides instructions for solving
puzzles together and battling enemies.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="cerberus">Cerberus</h4>
<p>In this brand game, all players start as survivors who must escape from
the cerberus. Cooperation is essential for this objective. However, as
everyone has the potential to be saved, players must sacrifice one
another as each individual who joins the cerberus&#39;s team becomes an
obstacle in their path.</p>
<h4 id="puzzles">Puzzles</h4>
<p>It will be interesting to understand how puzzles, with their
ultra-simple principles, can create collective relations and lead to the
formation of monuments.</p>
<h4 id="concept">Concept</h4>
<p>This game is a &#39;describe and guess&#39; game where players have to
describe a concept using a combination of pictograms representing simple
concepts. The interesting aspect of this game is that while it was
originally created with competitive features, they can feel unnatural
and players often choose to abandon them and play in cooperative mode
for the sake of fun.</p>

<p>Throughout the week, students organized themselves into inter-school
teams to develop game concepts. We ended the week with a day of public
opening and testing of the game prototypes. Students had the occasion to
get immediate feedback from various types of public including children.
It was also a great exercise for them to present their work to an
audience also composed of people out of the art and design field.</p>

<p>The concept of the game is that all participants have to reach the

there are challenges that need to be achieved. The challenges have
certain restrictions. If successful, you get closer to the center.
Except you&#39;re not the one doing the challenges. It&#39;s everyone
participating in the game that are doing the challenge for you. And you
moving closer to the center depends on how well they succeed in the
given challenge.</p>
<h4 id="your-success-depends-on-their-success">Your success depends on their success</h4>
<p>Think of it this way: Life throws you challenges, and many restrictions
come along. Many of them require your motivation but also the help of
others. Sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don&#39;t. But you keep on
trying. And that&#39;s life.</p>
<p>A small story for this game: <em>&quot;You thought you were just going to play
cards with your friends. But a strange murmur is charming you from the
center of the decks. You want to know more. You&#39;re curious. You try to
get closer, but a thin wall is stopping you reaching that voice. Walls
in the form of circles. You cannot go through alone. One challenge is
given to have the chance of hearing this charm of a voice and finding
the answer to your curiosity. That requires help. Bribes are in the way;
the cards reveal a way for you to move closer and closer. But beware,
those challenges hide glitches. You&#39;re bounded to the others. You
cannot move with the others. Follow the voice, unite and find that
murmur you&#39;re looking for.&quot;</em></p>
<h4 id="rules-and-restrictions-of-the-game">Rules and restrictions of the game</h4>
<p>The game is played by a minimum of five people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player will have a ticket that indicates their position.</li>
<li>All players will begin at the same circle (depending on the number
of players and rounds you&#39;d like to play) but the minimum is 3.</li>
<li>The youngest player gets the first call.</li>
<li>You have two decks of cards, one deck that is the challenge given
called &quot;challenge&quot; and the other that is restriction given for the
challenge the player will do which is called &quot;glitch&quot;.</li>
<li>Shuffle each deck at every turn, then draw a card from each deck.
You have to say what&#39;s the challenge and what&#39;s the restriction,
but you cannot participate in it.</li>
<li>Everyone on the same circle as the player calling the challenge, can
choose to participate by raising their hand and getting around the
caller.</li>
<li>With each call, one should be devoted (a minimum of one player) and
one should step aside. When the caller reveals the combination, a
given time is set and the responders will have to coordinate to
achieve the challenge together, as a scene.</li>
<li>It&#39;s up to the player aside to decide if the challenge has been a
success or not by raising their hand.</li>
<li>If it&#39;s a success, the caller of the challenge moves to the next
circle and chooses the next caller from the ones that have responded
to their call.</li>
<li>It the challenge was not a success; the next caller is chosen within
the players that are aside.</li>
</ul>
<p>When two people are alone in the same circle, they should go along with
the same combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, each of them picks on other player, and the teams
present their &quot;answer&quot; at the same time.</li>
<li>The selected player goes on and chooses the next caller or if it
leaves a player behind the group (on the lower circle), everyone should
join forces (even the caller) and &quot;answer&quot; the challenge for one to
pass.</li>
<li>The player keeps the call.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-was-the-process-during-the-game-design">What was the process during the game design?</h4>
<p>We started with the goal of creating a game that embodied the concept of
&quot;competitive by cooperation&quot;. This guiding principle helped us during
the brainstorming and ideation process. We began by mentioning different
game ideas that could fit into this category, such as Mario Party, Fall
Guys, and Simon Says. We then proceeded to describe these games and
identify common elements, such as the equal opportunities and fairness
given to all players. It was a collection of bits and pieces from
various games that we remembered, all falling under the theme of
&quot;competitive by cooperation&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="iteration-and-testing">Iteration and Testing</h4>
<p>For the iteration process, we relied on questioning every step and rule
we implemented. As we progressed in laying down the possible platform,
we constantly tore apart each idea by asking &#39;what if.&#39; This approach
allowed us to strip away unnecessary steps, rules, and gaps that the
game might not need, ensuring that all players would remain engaged,
progress, and enjoy the story.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, we were unable to physically test the game
extensively, as it requires a full immersion with a significant number
of people for a time period exceeding 5 or 10 minutes. However, we
conducted testing in two parts. Firstly, we showed our printed cards to
various individuals and observed their curiosity and excitement as they
imagined themselves undertaking the challenges and restrictions.
Secondly, during the exhibition day, we witnessed the actual immersive
experience of the game.</p>

<h4 id="game-concept-1">Game concept</h4>
<p>Spacimen is a game about survival, which is why it combines elements of
collaboration and competition. Up to four participants are given a
limited amount of time to create and shape a Spacimen (creature)
according to a set of predetermined parameters derived from a specific
natural environment. These parameters are presented in the form of
statements and a story, allowing players to imagine and interpret the
world in their own unique way.</p>
<h4 id="rules-of-the-game">Rules of the game</h4>
<ul>
<li>Shuffle the circular pieces of the Worlds and stack them face down.</li>
<li>Group the 4 Facts &amp; Scene cards according to the environments they
represent and place them within reach of all players.</li>
<li>Distribute an equal moment of clay to each player.</li>
<li>The round begins when one of the Worlds pieces is placed in the
center of the board.</li>
<li>When the World is revealed, all players must take the corresponding
card, read the Facts &amp; Scene and keep it visible.</li>
<li>Within 2 minutes, each player must build a Spacimen that can survive
in the given World, following the Facts &amp; Scene.</li>
<li>Each player must defend how &amp; why their Spacimen is the ideal
inhabitant for the given World.</li>
<li>Players must take notes, question, and assess every Spacimen&#39;s
features based on their viability in the World&#39;s described in the
Facts &amp; Scene.</li>
<li>1 point is awarded for the best feature for each fact of the World.</li>
<li>After defending their Spacimens and reviewing all the Facts have
been revised, players must calculate their earned points.</li>
<li>The player with the most points wins the round and the World. The
player with no points loses the round and can&#39;t play in the next
round.</li>
<li>The round for the next World may begin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Semi Final &amp; Final Trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>When only one World remains, all Spacimens must collaborate.</li>
<li>Before the assessment of the second-to-last World, all Spacimens
must find a partner for the final round.</li>
<li>The assessment proceeds as usual, but for the start of the final
round, they must work in pairs. One person models, and the other
person directs.</li>
<li>The player with more points in this round wins. In case of a tie,
the player with more Worlds wins overall.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="restrictions-of-the-game">Restrictions of the game</h4>
<ul>
<li>Players have 2 minutes to shape their Spacimen according to the given environment</li>
<li>Each fact represents a specific number of points, which determine the winner of the round.</li>
<li>The players must collectively decide who earns the points for each environment and discuss the reasons behind their decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="iteration">Iteration</h4>
<p>The discussion of the rules was an ongoing process. We did a draft of
the assumed rules, but definitely we had to try it out among ourselves
and with others to actually understand the needed logic for the game to
make sense and create a playful, yet collaborative &amp; competitive
environment as we have established our wish.</p>
<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<p>Before printing or cutting the pieces of the game, we tested the game
with the illustrations of the environments for testing the needed time
for shaping the creatures, to test with external audience if the
illustration made sense with the narrative facts and to also measure how
fun would the challenge and assessing the results be!</p>

<h4 id="end-result-1">End Result</h4>
<p>The final result demonstrated to be very fun for the audience. We saw
smiles, laughs, debating, stress and engagement while playing, which
successfully portrays the kind of game we wanted to design, searching
for surprises that stimulate imagination but also provide perspective
and stretch the standard way of thinking of the participants. We wanted
for this game to also foster communication between the participants, in
a debate form for taking decisions, as we believe that this would be a
very good example of how collaboration and competition can exist in the
same world.  </p>

<h4 id="progress">Progress</h4>
<p>We are currently discussing how to improve the rules and the logical
acquisition of points, aiming to create fewer controversies and make the
decisions less subjective. We want to better align the point system with
the elements of the game and the stories depicted in each world.</p>

<h5 id="natsumi-nonaka-viki-schmidt-dorothée-abaiadze">Natsumi Nonaka, Viki Schmidt, Dorothée Abaiadze</h5>
<h4 id="game-concept-2">Game concept</h4>
<p>Aela is a drawing game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and
encourages creativity. It is designed to be easy to understand and play,
without a specific goal but focused on having fun. If you feel you have
played enough, you should be able to stop playing at any time.</p>
<h4 id="rules-of-the-game-1">Rules of the game</h4>
<ul>
<li>You need at least three people to play the game. Two people form a
team, and the others guess.</li>
<li>The team picks a keyword and both team members roll the dice. The
displayed restriction is the rule they have to follow while drawing
the keyword.</li>
<li>Now, the team has 30 seconds to collaborate and create a drawing
that represents the chosen keyword, using only drawings without
talking.</li>
<li>Once the 30 seconds are over, the other players have to guess the
keyword based on both drawings.</li>
<li>To continue game, form new teams and start the next round.</li>
<li>Play for as long as you have fun. There&#39;s no winner or loser!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="restrictions-of-the-game-1">Restrictions of the game</h4>
<p>Each player is given a restriction in drawing by the dice.</p>
<p>They are also given a 30-second time limit for drawing and a restriction
not to speak while drawing.</p>
<h4 id="what-was-the-process-during-the-game-design-1">What was the process during the game design</h4>
<p>We started with just brainstorming around keywords like simple, body,
random, collaborative. Afterwards we tried to connect different words
and categories to combine them and formulate possible games out of it.
Then we came up with different contexts like where should it be played
and who should play it etc.</p>
<p><img src="img/fbcf641d-e086-4f5b-a658-5a7727a9e3de_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="fbcf641d-e086-4f5b-a658-5a7727a9e3de_1_105_c.jpeg"></p>

<h4 id="iteration-and-testing-1">Iteration and testing</h4>
<p>First, we came up with the idea of combining the whispering game with
drawing. We also made a paper dice to give players constraints such as
&quot;draw without looking&quot;. When we tested it, we found that the
constraint idea worked but it&#39;s too easy to play and the waiting time
was boring. Next, based on the feedback in the first test, we changed
our concept that two people working together to complete one picture
instead of one person drawing each. We also increased the variety of
constraints. In the second test, we saw participants enjoyed it much
more than before. Finally, we made wood dices with 8 faces, 40 cards
with keywords, and instruction paper. We selected keywords that are
conceptual and can be interpreted differently by different people such
as &quot;sustainable&quot;.</p>

<h5 id="morgane-rousseau-helen-staak-florens-schwendowius">Morgane Rousseau, Helen Staak, Florens Schwendowius</h5>
<h4 id="game-concept-3">Game concept</h4>
<p>The concept of the game is that a group of people have to throw a ball
collaboratively. They have to communicate well to coordinate their
movement, so that the ball flies in the right direction.</p>
<h4 id="rules-of-the-game-2">Rules of the game</h4>
<p>The game is played between two to four teams, each consisting of two to
four players. Each team uses three balls. To start, place the tiny pink
ball (called cochonnet) on the ground and distribute the different
shapes around it, ensuring an equal distance of one large step between
each shape.</p>
<p>Build teams and choose a color. Then, grab the fabric and balls of your
team&#39;s chosen color. Position yourselves five large steps away from the
cochonnet. In a team of four, each member gets a leash to grab. If there
are only two players in the team, each team member gets two leashes to
grab. Place a ball on top of the fabric. In a team of three, fold the
opposite corners of the fabric to create a triangle.</p>
<p>The aim is to get as close as possible to the cochonnet. Repeat this
step with the second and third ball. Once all the balls have been
thrown, measure which ball is closest to the cochonnet. The team that
has thrown this ball receives three points, while the team whose ball is
furthest away receives a deduction of one point.</p>
<p>After counting the points, collect the balls and start a new round. The
team that reaches nine points first is declared the winning team.</p>
<h4 id="shapes">Shapes</h4>
<p>When a thrown ball lands on a shape the team has to do an
extra difficulty in the next throw:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand on one leg during the next throw.</li>
<li>Close your eyes during the next throw.</li>
<li>You&#39;re not allowed to speak during the next throw.</li>
<li>Throw from five steps further away during the next throw.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="restrictions-of-the-game-2">Restrictions of the game</h4>
<p>Minimum two people in a team, maximum four. Minimum two teams, maximum
four. For the best experience, it is recommended to be played outdoors,
on grass, gravel or flat terrain, where the balls do not roll away or
bounce too much.</p>
<h4 id="what-was-the-process-during-the-game-design-2">What was the process during the game design?</h4>
<p>After going through a lot of ideas we landed on a concept, which we gave
a working name &quot;collaborative petanque&quot;. The initial inspiration came
from two already existing games: petanque and parachute. As petanque is
a very popular game around France, which we also saw played a lot around
the school grounds, we wanted to take this already familiar concept and
find ways to make it more collaborative.</p>
<p><img src="img/collaborative_petanque2.png" alt="bildschirmfoto_2022-04-13_um_10.30.01.png"></p>
<figcaption><i>Collanque</i> iteration with a quick testing-model</figcaption>

<br>
<br>

<h4 id="iteration-1">Iteration</h4>
<p>Our first idea was to use the regular petanque boules and some kind of
fabric that would be used to throw the boules. We tested the first idea
of the game outside on the school grounds by using a stone and a jacket.
When we saw that it could work, we started searching for materials to
create our first prototype. We were able to use the leftover fabric from
the Design Biennale and created our first version of the game. When the
fabric was done, we tested it with different paper balls and then bought
different sized balls from the store to see how they work with the game.
We also moved away from the original formation of the petanque game,
where people play the game one after each other in a line. We thought it
might be much more emotional, when the teams are placed in a circle
facing each other. After that we tested the game with two teams and
different kinds of balls outside on grass. Everything seemed to work
well, but we felt that the game was still missing something. We got a
recommendation from our mentors that we could add some additional
features to make the game more challenging. We decided to create shapes
out of cardboard that could be put on the ground while playing and would
challenge the players more. We also decided to add leashes to the fabric
so it would be more comfortable to hold them. The final version of the
shapes for the game were laser cut from plywood and we also decided to
engrave the challenges on them, so they would always be visually there
and easy to keep in mind while playing.</p>

<figcaption>Sewing the <i>Collanque</i> fabric elements</figcaption>

<h4 id="testing-1">Testing</h4>
<p>The testing was a crucial part in our design process. Right from the
start we tested our ideas and developed them further with the
experiences we made. While testing the game the participants had very
interesting ideas for variations of the game that differed from the
original idea.</p>
<p>Therefore, the game could additionally be used in other ways as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the fabrics to throw and catch a ball in two teams of two to
four people</li>
<li>Using the circle shape in the middle to throw the ball through it
and catch it with the fabric</li>
<li>Using the circle in the middle on the ground and make the ball
bounce in the middle of the circle</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="end-result-2">End Result</h4>
<p>The end result is the game called &#39;Collanque.&#39; The name is a
combination of &#39;petanque,&#39; the word for a French boules sport in which
players play their balls towards a target ball. The game consists of one
small ball to place in the middle, three different sized and weighted
balls for each team to throw, fabrics for teams of two to four people to
throw the balls with, and four different shapes to put on the ground for
extra challenges.</p>

<p>You play as a designer who is always seeking new technology to improve
their work. In pursuit of this, you purchased a brand new 5D printer
from a dubious website. Excited to test its capabilities, you attempted
to print a file, but to your surprise, it caused a rift, splitting your
reality in half. Now, you and your friend must work together to merge</p>
<h4 id="rules-of-the-game-3">Rules of the game</h4>
<p>Your room, which used to be purple, has been affected by the split in
reality, resulting in two dimensions. As a consequence, your room, along
with some objects within it, has been divided into the red room and the
blue room. One player interacts with the split reality of the red room,
while the other player is in the blue room. The objects in each room
that are colored opposite to their surroundings hold the keys to
restoring and fixing the merged reality.</p>
<p>When the objects affected by the split reality are placed into the 5D
printer, they reveal riddles that provide codes for teleporting the
objects to their respective realities. Some of the riddles require
collaboration with your friend, as crucial hints are hidden in their
room. The ultimate goal is to solve all the riddles and successfully
merge the realities, allowing you to return to your original purple
room.
the two realities back into one.</p>
<h4 id="restrictions-of-the-game-3">Restrictions of the game</h4>
<p>Communication with your friend is not possible within the game itself.
As the game is designed to be played in different physical locations,
you must find alternative ways to communicate, such as through phone
calls or text messages, to emulate the experience of being in different
realities. The game can be played offline, as it consists of two mystery
games intended to be played simultaneously, with each game containing
hints that are relevant to the other player&#39;s game.</p>

<h4 id="what-was-the-process-during-the-game-design-3">What was the process during the game design?</h4>
<p>Initially, we contemplated creating a detective or mystery game. While
the basic idea was present from the start, the plot required some
adjustments as it would serve as the central element of the game. We
began by discussing the story of a physics professor whose science
experiment went awry, resulting in the splitting of his reality into two
separate dimensions.</p>

<h4 id="testing-2">Testing</h4>
<p>We created and developed various riddles, and then approached different
people to solve them. The solving time varied, with some riddles proving
more challenging while others were relatively straightforward. The
difficulty often depended on the individual&#39;s experience and
familiarity with the subject matter. Knowledge of pop culture references
proved helpful during the solving process. Considering our target
audience, we wanted to appeal to individuals who grew up with these pop
culture moments and could share them with people from other generations.
To ensure accessibility for everyone, we decided to include hints within
the game.</p>

<h4 id="game-concept-5">Game concept</h4>
<p>The Cube is a cooperative game designed for two players, combining
elements of interactive storytelling and escape games. The game revolves
around a story where one friend finds themselves trapped in a bar with
no recollection of their whereabouts due to excessive drinking. They
reach out to another friend for help and rescue. The objective is to
successfully save the trapped friend, leading to a happy ending.</p>
<p>In the game, one player assumes the role of the trapped friend inside
the bar. They navigate the bar through a series of images that they can
switch between, exploring their surroundings to gather information that
they must then relay to their friend. The other player engages with the
game on a computer, presented with choices and riddles that they must
communicate with their partner to answer correctly.</p>
<h4 id="rules-of-the-game-4">Rules of the game</h4>
<p>You have to communicate with your partner in order to win. Spamming
through answers is not allowed. You need to actually try to complete the
riddles. You are not allowed to see what the other person sees.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t inspect scenes in more detail.</p>
<h4 id="what-was-the-process-during-the-game-design-4">What was the process during the game design</h4>
<p>Firstly, we decided to create a video game. Then we came up with the
idea of making it a storytelling game with choices and cooperative
gameplay. We proceeded to sketch out the game&#39;s path and assigned tasks
to each team member. The process went smoothly, and everyone actively
contributed. While we all worked on the story, special thanks go to
Maëlys for contributing most of the good ideas. Maëlys and Alféa created
the 3D models and scenes using Blender, while Mark developed and coded
the playable part of the game in Twine.</p>

<h5 id="alina-remlinger-sarah-boutière-katrin-koskela">Alina Remlinger, Sarah Boutière, Katrin Koskela</h5>
<h4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
<p>Our inspiration was the <em>trax</em> game. We liked the simplicity, the shapes
and the intuitive way the game was designed. However, we wanted to
design a game for more than two players, so we needed to bring the game
to a higher complexity.</p>
<h4 id="conception">Conception</h4>
<p>To make the game more collaborative, we made the decision for each
player to choose one color. Using the same concept of lines on the
square cards, the goal is for players to connect the starting and ending
points of their chosen color. During this phase, we were introduced to
the game <em>Connect</em> by Ken Garland, which captivated us with its
geometric and simple appearance. Additionally, we discovered the synonym
of <em>train</em> or <em>metro</em> tracks, which further resonated with our game
concept.</p>
<h4 id="paper-prototype">Paper prototype</h4>
<p>We decided to create small squares with the various geometric shapes
needed for our game in our initial <strong>paper prototype</strong>. During this
stage, we discovered that there are numerous possible variations, which
led us to the realization that we needed to determine the specific
versions and quantity of cards required for a playable and enjoyable
game.</p>
<p>After creating the squares for the paper prototype, we gathered to play
a round and refine the game&#39;s details. We soon realized the need to
limit the number of colors on each tile and enforce the rule of having
only one line exiting from each side. Without these restrictions, it
would become excessively challenging to find matching pieces for the
players to connect. As a result, we ended up with eleven distinct
pieces, each with its own color variations.</p>

<h4 id="final-game">Final game</h4>
<p>Our game is called &#39;Metro,&#39; and the goal is to complete the metro line
and conclude your travels. It is designed for up to four players, with
each player needing to complete their colored lines. Our final prototype
consisted of 72 unique pieces and included the game instructions.</p>
<h4 id="rules">Rules</h4>
<p>Game for two to four players.</p>
<p>Before the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player chooses one color (orange, red, blue or green). The
pieces with end and start points are part of the stack and must be
found by drawing a new piece each turn.</li>
<li>Each player gets three pieces, the remaining pieces are stacked on
the side.</li>
<li>The player whose birthday is next starts the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player begins by drawing a piece from the stack <strong>or</strong> from the
already constructed metro plan (not possible for the very first
move)</li>
<li>One of the four pieces <strong>must</strong> <strong>now</strong> <strong>be added to the metro
plan</strong>.</li>
<li>Pieces can only be added if the lines fit with all the surrounding
pieces.</li>
<li>Pieces must be placed in a way that each &quot;empty&quot; space has no more
than two different colors ending it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="congratulations">Congratulations!</h4>
<p>The player who has both their starting and ending point of the metro
line connected first, wins.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-openings">Conclusion and openings</h2>
<p>During the first workshop in Tallinn, we had the feeling of passing an
important step, this was also the case here.</p>
<p>The notions of collaboration, cooperation and participation appeared
more complex than we had anticipated: it was the major topic of the week
and students were invited to participate to the reflection on those
notions.</p>
<p>The theme of games fulfilled its purpose to serve as a common cultural
basis, with students tracking the tiny national differences of some of
them and sharing games they like. It also allowed students to design
games with the technical knowledge and tools at their disposal
respectively within their team and within Esadse. Everyone was then in a
kind of &quot;comfort area&quot; since no methods or tools were imposed.</p>
<p>The process of the game design also allowed us to step aside and move
away, for a moment, from the digital and functional perspectives that we
are used to.</p>
<p>Finally, we had the feeling that student had a great time and got the
chance to know better each other&#39;s, mostly by working together in
international teams. Their differences in methods were less visible than
in the previous workshop and were mostly perceived as an added value.</p>

<p>New workshop, new rules.</p>
<p>At HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd, Marc Guntow, Ludwig Kannicht, and Florian
Geiselhart introduced a new working format in the form of three
simultaneous workshops, each focusing on specific organizations and
subjects. These workshops were conducted during the International
Workshops Week at HfG, providing a valuable opportunity to share the
outcomes with a large audience during the final presentation at the end
of the week. The entire school transformed into a museum, with workshop
exhibitions displayed in various rooms.</p>
<h4 id="lets-kill-zoom-calls">Lets Kill zoom calls</h4>
<p>Florian revisited the subject we had previously discussed, which
involved taking a critical approach to reinventing communication
software such as Zoom. We will delve further into this workshop in the
following chapter.</p>
<h4 id="collaborative-interaction-patterns">Collaborative interaction patterns</h4>
<p>Marc suggested exploring the history of the mouse pointer and examining
potential contemporary advancements. We will provide further explanation
about this workshop in a later section.</p>
<h4 id="radical-collaboration">Radical collaboration</h4>
<p>At Ludwig&#39;s suggestion, we embarked on a reflection about the dynamics
of collaboration in our workplaces and school teams. We explored the key
conditions for effective teamwork, strategies for resolving challenging
collaboration situations, and appropriate behaviors towards our
teammates. We also considered whether it is advisable to openly share
our personal feelings within a professional context. Throughout the
project, we maintained a project logbook on our wiki, which is
reproduced below.</p>

<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<h4 id="am">A.M.</h4>
<p>At first, the students formed groups of three to four people to discuss
their expectations for the workshop week.</p>
<p>They collectively shared their motivations using the popcorn method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring the meaning of collaboration and understanding if it
differs for each individual.</li>
<li>Meeting new people and reconnecting with the students they had met
in previous DTCC workshops.</li>
<li>Taking a break from their job and being a full-time student.</li>
<li>Learning the fundamentals of working together after experiencing
challenges or failures in previous team projects.</li>
<li>Overcoming frustration in teamwork, stop being a people pleaser and
finding their place within a team.</li>
<li>Finding their strengths and valuing them in teamwork.</li>
<li>Breaking away from the usual teams, embracing different work habits
and methods.</li>
<li>Improving interpersonal interactions.</li>
<li>Discovering the city.</li>
<li>Analyzing previous team projects that went only &quot;ok&quot;.</li>
<li>Finding good pretzels.</li>
<li>Managing tensions within a group to enhance overall team
performance.</li>
<li>Escaping from personal projects for a week.</li>
<li>Freshening up English skills.</li>
<li>Overcoming difficulties in working within teams.</li>
<li>Party!</li>
<li>Learning how to communicate to avoid frustration, and dividing tasks
based on teammates&#39; skills and strengths.</li>
<li>Creating a cohesive team that goes beyond a mere combination of
individual projects.</li>
<li>Finding a balance between enjoyment and productivity: Too much work
is actually less efficiency.</li>
<li>Focusing on collaboration on itself.</li>
<li>Tasting some good beers.</li>
<li>Getting to know a new aspect of oneself.</li>
<li>Breaking the habit of constantly assuming leadership within a team,
reducing personal stress.</li>
<li>Being more comfortable in a group setting.</li>
<li>Having a theoretical background on collaboration.</li>
<li>Preparing for future collaborations with individuals they didn&#39;t
choose, accommodating different work styles within the school
context.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, students discussed their experiences with teamwork within
small groups, then shared them with the whole group.</p>
<p>Ludwig has shown a video by Marianne Simmel and Fritz Heider (1944) and
asked students to reflect on what they observed first individually and
then, back in groups.</p>
<h4 id="pm">P.M.</h4>
<p>The afternoon started with some teambuilding exercices.</p>
<p>Then, the group discussed what they could present for the exhibition on
Friday to empower fellow designers for teamwork. Ludwig asked them to
also think of future teammates who hadn&#39;t been there. They formed two
discussion circles.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they presented their discussions using the
fishbowl method. They arranged a circle of listeners around a smaller
circle for speakers. People in the center had a discussion while those
on the outer circle listened. If someone from the outer circle wanted to
speak, they could join the center circle. If there was no more space in
the center, the person who had been speaking the longest would give up
their seat. The goal of this exercise was to reach agreement on ideas
and create a cohesive plan for the exhibition on Friday.</p>

<figcaption>End of day meeting</figcaption>

<p>For now, they have agreed to create performances, documentation (to
capture what happened), and a printed takeaway publication (such as a
poster, booklet, or cards?)</p>
<p>As a conclusion, throughout the day, they experienced working in small
teams (3-4 members), medium teams (2 groups), and as a large team (all
together). They concluded the journey by collectively reflecting on
their own feelings about working in these teams during the day.
Additionally, Ludwig asked for feedback from the students, seeking their
input on what he should keep, what he should drop, and what he should
change to improve his preparation for the next days.</p>
<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<h4 id="am-1">A.M.</h4>
<p>We started the workshop a bit later this morning due to beginning the
day with a guided tour of the school led by Marc. At 10:30, Ludwig
announced the schedule for the week and provided students with a
template example of an email for soliciting feedback. In fact,
yesterday, students suggested requesting 10 to 15 minutes of feedback on
their proposals from three to six different people.</p>
<p>Then, it was time for the initial team building. Ludwig prompted the
students to reflect and engage in a collective discussion about their
&#39;origin systems&#39;: what values or aspects do they hold dear and would
like to see in their new group? What would they prefer to leave behind?
Additionally, Ludwig encouraged them to envision elements they never
experienced before but would like to initiate. He also requested that
they find metaphors to represent their &quot;origin systems&quot;.</p>
<p>At the end of the morning, the students began working on how they wanted
to organize themselves as a team for the exhibition. Using the fish
bubble method, they aimed to collectively decide on defining sub-teams
to divide tasks.</p>
<p>Initially, they came up with the idea of creating three teams, each
responsible for a specific aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Traces</li>
<li>Take-away</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they soon realized the need to establish connections between
these teams to ensure that all parts merged together as a cohesive
project. This sparked a lively debate on the necessary adjacent roles to
maintain coherence throughout the separated components of the exhibition
project. Additionally, there was a discussion on how to precisely define
the teams.</p>

<figcaption>Planning teamwork</figcaption>

<p><img src="img/IMG_5155.JPG" alt="IMG_5155.jpg"></p>
<figcaption>Debate on how to organize the collective work</figcaption>

<h4 id="pm-1">P.M</h4>
<p>The debate initiated in the morning continued at the beginning of the
afternoon. They decided to make flexible teams for now.</p>
<p>Ludwig then initiated a talk about three forms of power:</p>
<ul>
<li>power of sovereignty: the given power through hierarchy (top-down, sometimes bottom-up through vote).</li>
<li>power of sense-making: the power given by other members of the team because what someone is saying is making sense
to others (bottom-up). This power is mostly relying on charisma.</li>
<li>power of the creator: this power relies on people thinking that a person is a
rightful leader, capable of being in charge of a specific project and
push-it forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Power is not only a matter of &quot;control&quot;. It is important to understand
these different types of power because power is also a means of
influencing a project. Power can help expedite decision-making, but it
should not be used to corrupt. An interesting question raised by a
student was: should people in power be individuals who do not desire to
be leaders to prevent the abuse of power?</p>
<p>After this talk, they made small groups to exchange their experiences of
these forms of power. Ludwig asked them to reflect on their strengths
and weaknesses in being a leader.</p>
<p>Afterward, Ludwig had a talk about tensions and the need to be able to
manage tensions when working in teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>sense of tensions</li>
<li>collect tensions</li>
<li>address tensions</li>
</ul>
<p>He made a link between tensions and non-violent communication and
criticized the term itself. Communication would always be about
information transfer and relationship clarification. A message always
come in both layers and is received in both layers. The relationship
layer always defines the interpretation of the information. Voice, tone,
attitude (non-verbal communication) are sub-messages that impact how the
information is transmitted.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-complete-communication">What is a complete communication?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Observation: What is causing tension?</li>
<li>Feelings: What triggers these feelings in me?</li>
<li>Need: What is important to me?</li>
<li>Request: What could bring me closer?</li>
</ul>
<p>During this process of communication, Ludwig insisted on the importance
of following certain rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be present (in the situation).</li>
<li>Be authentic (express your true feelings).</li>
<li>Be empathetic (have a good understanding of your point of view but
also seek to understand the situation your interlocutor is in).</li>
</ul>
<p>This slide moment was then followed by a role play.</p>

<p>How did you feel on that day? How did these exercises develop a sense of
group and collaboration? Can you share your experience, if you wish, in
a few lines?</p>
<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>
<h4 id="am-2">A.M</h4>
<p>This morning, the workshop started with a little game to wake everybody
up after last night&#39;s mulled-wine party at school. Then, Ludwig gave a
presentation about &quot;How to: critical feedback.&quot; To explain the value
square concept in a more interactive way, he asked students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide positive feedback to one another.</li>
<li>Share a value they see in someone and its counterpart.</li>
<li>Devalue someone&#39;s value (e.g., a flexible person =&gt; you are
chaotic) to illustrate overcompensation, which can be a source of
conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lecture was supposed to be followed by an activity where students
could experiment with giving and receiving feedback. However, due to a
lack of time, they held a vote and decided to skip this activity in
order to have more time to work on Friday&#39;s exhibition. Before
returning to their exhibition teams, they did a quick activity to share
the feedback they received yesterday.</p>
<h4 id="pm-2">P.M.</h4>
<p>The afternoon was dedicated to project work, with students divided into
teams working on a poster, a performance, and its script. One of the
students was assigned the role of coordinating between the teams.</p>

<figcaption>"Why are you here?" final performance</figcaption>

<h3 id="final-presentation">Final presentation</h3>
<p>The performance took place three times on the final day, which was
dedicated to the presentation of all the workshops conducted throughout
the week. It was accompanied by a poster that served as a take-away,
containing the key reflections and insights generated by the students
during the workshop.</p>
<p>The performance titled &quot;<em>Why are you here?</em>&quot; was a participative play
that depicted a conflictual collaboration situation. The audience was
actively engaged throughout the performance and was regularly invited to
make choices on how to react to the unfolding situation. These decisions
directly influenced the course of the collaboration.</p>
<p>The performance drew inspiration from forum theater, a technique
developed by Brazilian theater director Augusto Boal as part of the
Theater of the Oppressed (TO) methodology. However, the students chose
to structure their performance as a multiple-choice experience, where
the possibilities were somewhat constrained, rather than a completely
open-ended play allowing for spontaneous action from the spect-actors.</p>

<p>The following texts are a short selection of transcripts from video
interviews we conducted with students who participated in one or more
workshops organized as part of the DTCC project. Our choice was focused
on stories that clearly demonstrate some of the issues arising from the
convergence of our three approaches to design and pedagogy. Each
workshop, in its unique way, served as a stage in the collaborative
learning process.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-most-interesting-aspects-of-this-cooperation-between-three-countries">What are the most interesting aspects of this cooperation between three countries?</h4>
<p>The best part for me about this project was that I had the opportunity
to participate in these five-day workshops with students from France and
Germany. I usually study design in Estonia, and I was surprised to see
that German and French students approach design in a very different way
from how we do it in Estonia. At first, it wasn&#39;t always easy for me to
adapt to their approaches. But as we worked together, I started to
realize that there was a lot that I could learn from them. And in the
end, I became grateful for our differences and was able to open up to
trying new things. And I also think that this experience has helped me
grow, and I am happy that we have been able to build such a good
relationship between students from these three countries through this
project. Overall, I really appreciated the workshops.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-have-an-anecdote-of-something-you-experienced-during-the-project-that-stuck-in-your-mind">Do you have an anecdote of something you experienced during the project that stuck in your mind?</h4>
<p>I have a moment that stuck in my mind, which was during the workshop in
Germany. It&#39;s about the words of my team-mate from France. When we were
designing a mouse pointer at the workshop, me and another team-mate, and
first we were trying to make it look like a living thing, so that people
would feel more affection for &quot;their&quot; mouse pointer. But the French
girl told us: &quot;I don&#39;t like humanizing the computer so much.&quot; Her
words really struck me. She said that the computer is just a combination
of ones and zeros, and that there is a risk of &quot;over-humanizing&quot; it. For example, smart home devices are so familiar to us that we take it for granted that they are in our homes. But in fact, a lot of personal
information is collected by them without us noticing and companies are
using that data to make more money. Honestly, I had never really thought about it. I only focused on designing things that are easy to use and pleasing to their users. </p>
<p>So, her critical attitude was quite eye-opening for me. I am grateful for her role in changing my perspective. That&#39;s why I strongly remember that moment.</p>
<h4 id="what-did-you-learn-from-the-other-partner-schools-and-their-approach-to-design">What did you learn from the other partner schools and their approach to design?</h4>
<p>I have learned a lot from the French and German students. Esadse, HfG
and EKA each have very different approaches to design. I believe that
French students prefer an organic approach. They follow their intuition
rather than strict adherence to theories and enhance their understanding
through hands-on activities. In contrast, I believe that the German
students possess a strong understanding of design thinking and its
methodology, and they strive to incorporate this knowledge into their
projects. They are also quite good at time management. I think EKA&#39;s
approach is somewhat similar to the German one. We usually proceed step
by step based on the double diamond design process. The approach of
French students was totally different from ours, so, at first, it
wasn&#39;t easy for me to follow their way of working. But since I trusted
their process and worked with them, I gained new perspectives. This
experience meant a lot to me. I think it has also influenced my attitude
towards design. And, of course, I learned a lot from the German students
as well. Their project management abilities are exceptional, and I
believe this is crucial for success in the real world. And I am also
grateful for learning documentation and time management skills from the
German students.</p>

<h4 id="what-have-you-learned-from-our-partner-schools-and-their-approach-to-design">What have you learned from our partner schools and their approach to design?</h4>
<p>So, in general it was really exciting for me to see how people have a
quite different mentality in France and that they have less structure,
but it still works, and that this actually helped me in the end. Because
at HfG in particular the way of working is much more analytical. And
sometimes it is difficult to make decisions intuitively. And I think the
trip to France reminded me of listening to my gut feeling again from
time to time.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-you-students-adjust-to-each-other-during-this-short-workshop-week">How did you students adjust to each other during this short workshop week?</h4>
<p>Well, we were actually a group of two, so it was maybe a bit easier. But
it was quite satisfying because we always sketched lots of things in
order to come to a common understanding of what we both meant in that
situation. So, in the end we had a big poster on which we had made lots
of little sketches to communicate about small games that everybody knows
but that may have different meanings or different names in the
respective country. And yes, we adjusted a lot through sketches
actually. I found that inspiring, because it demonstrated that if you
visualize something, you can come to a common understanding much better,
in communication in general and especially as a designer.</p>
<h4 id="so-drawing-was-a-universal-communication-channel-that-worked-for-you">So drawing was a universal communication channel that worked for you?</h4>

<p>I was able to do all three workshops, so I could have a different
experience on each of them. That allowed me, mainly the first workshop
allowed me to gain a lot of self-confidence in the sense that I had
several times... How can I put it? In fact, it taught me to stand up
for myself when I felt there were things that went against my
principles. It also allowed me to dare to speak a lot more. And I know
that since this workshop, I am more likely to stop letting things pass
when they rush me or bother me or don&#39;t go well in a project. So that
really did something for me in that sense. And I also learned a lot
about methods, [specific] methods that were used [then].</p>
<h4 id="have-you-been-able-to-combine-different-working-methods-in-your-group-or-did-one-method-take-over">Have you been able to combine different working methods in your group or did one method take over?</h4>
<p>No, we haven&#39;t. Overall, it worked rather poorly, I think. Is it good or
bad that it didn&#39;t work? I don&#39;t know that, but I have the impression
that I have also learned that methods are not neutral in themselves and
tools are also not neutral. And in fact, I realized that the tools that
we are using, and the methods, they strongly shape our way of thinking
and our way of working. We cannot separate the tools and methods we use
from the way we use them. I could see and feel that strongly because
[during the workshop], many methods were, well, not imposed on us, but
suggested and from the moment we use them, they are very difficult to
reappropriate. Because the methods have an influence on the rythm of the
work, they prevent us a bit from getting out of a well-defined, straight
line, like a train on rails. And it&#39;s true that as a result, it was a
great opportunity for me to look into how these [design] methods work.
Why do they make sure that other methods become obsolete, or in any case
prevent us from deploying other methods? What strategies can be adopted
to manage to distort them, to transform them? So that was a bit like the
personal approach I had in there. And yes, on the collaborative aspect,
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily a failure, because it would be like
putting a good or bad label on it, but it did not necessarily work as we
might have hoped. But at the same time, I say to myself that
collaboration is not an end in itself. It is rather a way of proceeding
to achieve a project. As a result, I know that now I am a little more
wary of people who want to collaborate at all costs before making good
projects. That&#39;s it.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-most-interesting-aspects-of-this-cooperation-between-three-countries-1">What are the most interesting aspects of this cooperation between three countries?</h4>
<p>My initial observation is that the students from all three schools hold
a particular perspective or inclination [towards design]. Regarding
the French students, I observed that they uphold the principle of
equality for all. Everyone needs to be considered. Moreover, during our
workshop encounter, I learned from them that design or design thinking
does not always work as intended. At times, we may need to delve deeper
into imagination, while at other times, we need to be more grounded in
humanity. The students from Germany employ a linear design process,
following a structured approach from A to Z, in a very organized way.
Thus, from them, I gained insights into being well-organized, while from
the French students, I learned about the importance of imagination and
the value of taking a human approach instead of always following the
crowd. The German students taught me to work in an organized manner and
also to think in an organized way. From my friends at EKA I learned the
importance of being receptive &quot;like a sponge&quot;, as they communicate and
gather insights from everyone. They taught me to actively listen and
strive to understand before taking any subsequent actions.</p>
<h4 id="can-you-describe-the-best-and-the-worst-moments-during-these-workshops">Can you describe the best and the worst moments during these workshops?</h4>
<p>Why was it [workshop in Tallinn] the best and worst moment? Because we
all had diverse backgrounds and varied approaches to reasoning. I
believe that the students from EKA and Germany share a similar way of
thinking, but we were already in the middle of our semester project and
we started designing and putting ideas together. We noticed that the
students from France seemed somewhat detached and hesitant towards our
approach to work. This resulted in an unstructured and sometimes
immature discussion, with arguments being presented in a random and
chaotic manner, causing our voices to raise, and highlighting the
differences in our perspectives. However, despite our differences, we
were able to eventually converge on a single idea. We were able to do
this by actively listening to each other adjusting our thoughts and
identifying the positive aspects and opportunities in each other&#39;s
perspectives, which allowed us to work collaboratively towards a common
goal. We were able to leverage our collective strengths and generate
more interaction, all in line with the theme of our overall subject,
which is Digital Collaboration.</p>

<h4 id="can-you-describe-the-best-andor-the-worst-moments-during-this-workshop-or-any-workshop">Can you describe the best and/or the worst moments during this workshop or any workshop?</h4>
<p>During the first workshop, there was a pretty cool moment when we formed
our teams and where we introduced ourselves and the expectations we had
for the workshop. And to realize that there were other people that,
especially the person with whom I later worked, who was from Estonia,
who really wanted to work on the same things as me, but with a very
different point of view. [He wanted] to do it because it was a
workshop and he wanted to do things a little less as usual, he was
curious to experiment. And instantly, we both had the feeling to be able
to contribute something to the work of the respective other person. And
that was really cool. On the more complicated moments, those were more
about ways of working since we are used to super different processes,
especially during the second workshop where we were in a group with two
persons from my school and two from the German school and they would
work (on the project) according to protocol in a very method-based way,
with a very defined process, whereas we felt the need, to discuss things
more freely, and that was painful for them to discuss freely because
they were so used to their methodical protocol. So, there was a day when
we really struggled to just get along and succeed to produce something
that suited everyone. That was the most complicated.</p>
<h4 id="what-was-interesting-for-you-about-collaborating-with-someone-who-works-in-a-very-different-way">What was interesting for you about collaborating with someone who works in a very different way?</h4>
<p>I found it very interesting that, even during times when it was super
complicated because working methods were incompatible on certain points,
it pushed us to do things that we really were not used to and we had to
get out of our comfort zone, even when that meant to do things that do
not put us in a very creative position and where we will not get to
produce something that we actually like, to just change our point of
view on how we work. And that was super fun in the end, even if at the
time it was difficult, in hindsight. I really feel that I have
reevaluated my own way of thinking and working. And it is satisfying to
have succeeded in doing so and that was quite productive from this point
of view: I now reconsider things in a different way and, even if i
don&#39;t apply the methods that I have seen during the workshop in
Germany, I have reached a broader perspective on different ways of
working.</p>

        <h1 id="designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration">Designing Tools for Creative Collaboration</h1>
<p>In this chapter, our aim is to delve into our approach to designing
tools for creative collaboration within the context of our schools,
while also considering the perspective of professional designers. This
unique perspective provides valuable insights on how to prepare students
for their lives &quot;beyond the classroom&quot;.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will revisit two workshops that took place at HfG Schwäbisch
Gmünd. These workshops specifically centered around the design of
alternative communication tools and their interfaces, such as <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-1/">video-call
software</a> and <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-2/">mouse pointers for simultaneous collaboration</a>. As we
initially approached the topic of digital tools for collaboration in art
and design, our focus was on the tools utilized within our schools and
by professionals for remote collaboration, which became increasingly
prevalent during the pandemic when in-person meetings were not feasible.
These communication tools primarily fall within a broader category that
is not exclusive to the creative field, representing only a limited
spectrum of what currently exists and what could be imagined for
creative collaboration tools. Through our exploration of digital
technology within our own practices, we came to realize that while
improvements could certainly be made to these tools, what we truly
yearned for during times when physical meetings were not possible were
creative devices for collaboration and the ability to create together.</p>
<p>With the rise of international collaborations, telework, and remote
education, facilitating remote creative collaborations has become a
significant challenge and objective for digital product companies.
However, it&#39;s important to note that the exploration of online creative
collaborations predates lockdowns and has been an ongoing endeavor since
the advent of personal computers. This very issue forms the foundation
of the Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) culture, which
emphasizes collective practices of creating, improving, repairing,
maintaining, and forking tools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many artists and designers, either through their
programming skills or in collaboration with programmers, are actively
opting to code their own tools as a means to break free from the
restrictions and costs associated with proprietary software. This
approach allows them to adopt a holistic perspective on technology,
which we believe holds significant value in teaching our students. The
second part of this chapter focuses on  <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-3/">Nolwenn Maudet&#39;s insightful
reflection on the development of collaborative tools</a> created by graphic
designers as alternatives to proprietary software, with the aim of
overcoming creative limitations.</p>
<p>What emerges from these predominantly collective practices are often
context-specific tools. One particularly intriguing aspect of some of
these productions is their ambiguous status: they exist as both
artworks and tools. To provide further insights into the design practice
of creating tools for creative collaborations, we have included an
article by <a href="https://digitaltoolsforcreativecollaboration.art/designing-tools-for-creative-collaboration/5-4/">designer Sarah Garcin, who shares her interactive and
collaborative experiences</a>. This text will be featured on
<em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>, an online platform that serves as a
participatory catalog of collective artistic digital projects. Designed
to be utilized, enriched, and refined by students, artists, designers,
and researchers alike, we will provide a comprehensive description of
the platform and its objectives at the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

<p>Florian Geiselhart, a computer scientist and former temporary professor
at HfG, played a significant role during the pandemic by creating
hfg.design 1.0, a teaching platform. Currently, he is actively working
on the development of the 2.0 version. Florian not only provides
technical guidance to students but also offers design support throughout
their projects.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-overview-of">A quick overview of...</h3>
<p>Florian discussed the tools we utilize for remote collaboration,
highlighting that most collaborative tools are designed for productivity
rather than creative work. We cannot deny the limitations of platforms
like Zoom when it comes to fostering true creative engagement. We can&#39;t
argue on Zoom.</p>
<p><img src="img/211122_presentation.jpg" alt="presentation"></p>
<figcaption>Introduction of the workshop by Florian</figcaption>

<p>We collected several thoughts regarding Zoom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication is constantly active on Zoom, not on-off.</li>
<li>It enables us to be together despite physical separation.</li>
<li>What about non-verbal communication when we are not speaking?</li>
<li>Many conversations often happen simultaneously.</li>
<li>How can we share emotions and atmosphere, not just information?</li>
</ul>
<p>Following that, we played a game to break the ice: Two truths and a lie.</p>
<h3 id="making-teams">Making teams</h3>
<p>Each student wrote down their thoughts on a piece of paper regarding the
various topics related to video calls discussed during the initial days.
Here is an excerpt of the ideas compiled:</p>
<p><img src="img/miro_notions__20221122.png" alt="miro_notions__20221122.png"></p>
<figcaption>Pooling thoughts via Miro</figcaption>

<ul>
<li>You can do your own break when working remotely.</li>
<li>You can&#39;t really assess how other person feels.</li>
<li>Non-verbal clues are important.</li>
<li>Feelings of closeness or distance to others depending on their
location in the room is absent via Zoom.</li>
<li>Legs are hidden.</li>
<li>&quot;Synchronization&quot; between people when someone is talking, is
easier to avoid speaking at the same time.</li>
<li>How to have a view on work progress of others?</li>
<li>Physical touch is missing.</li>
<li>Getting up to stick the post-it notes to an absent wall.</li>
<li>The truth/lie game wouldn&#39;t be so funny on Zoom.</li>
<li>Small chats in between meetings.</li>
<li>Smell of a room.</li>
<li>Sitting together.</li>
<li>Side-talks.</li>
<li>Seeing the emotions (gestures/mimics) of other participants that are
not talking.</li>
<li>Rudimentary extra-class interactions.</li>
<li>Breaks (all at the same place) are missing.</li>
<li>Everyone would talk to each other&#39;s after a IRL meeting, not as a
whole group.</li>
<li>Natural group-building.</li>
<li>Small talk.</li>
<li>Chilled atmosphere.</li>
<li>Eye contact.</li>
<li>Direct feedback because everyone is muted.</li>
<li>Work/life balance.</li>
<li>Being in the same environment/experience the same environment as the
others.</li>
</ul>
<p>After collecting our ideas, we formed the groups by deliberately mixing
the students, primarily based on their areas of interest as much as
possible.</p>
<h3 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h3>
<p>After first day ended, the rest of the week was dedicated to work on
teams&#39; projects that were presented at the end of the international
workshop week in HfG.</p>

<h5 id="maëlys-bard-alféa-morelli-lars-dörper-maximilian-becht">Maëlys Bard, Alféa Morelli, Lars Dörper, Maximilian Becht</h5>
<p><em>echo</em> is a 2D virtual environment that allows users to move around in a
video-call space. We focused on the spatial and sonic aspect of group
work by imagining that it would be possible to move closer to the people
you want to listen to and further away from others rather than mutating
to simulate the sensation of sharing a space with other people. In echo,
users can interact with each other in many ways such as sharing a
presentation, activating magnetism to automatically follow the person as
they move, or teleport to each other. The idea of this project is to get
away from the strict and static aspect of the grid.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-this-tool-for">Who is this tool for?</h4>
<p>Our software can be used by creative teams that need to work remotely,
by groups of friends or by companies, mostly large groups.</p>
<h4 id="what-type-of-collaboration-is-it-for-sychroneousasynchroneous-collaborativecooperativeparticipative">What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?</h4>
<p>On <em>echo</em>, you can work alone while maintaining direct contact with your
colleagues, collaborate simultaneously as a team, or simply present your
work and hold meetings. It&#39;s a versatile tool that supports various
types of collaboration.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-impact-the-collaboration">How does it impact the collaboration?</h4>
<p>We designed <em>echo</em> as a way to maintain a connection between
individuals, immersing them in the same environment to foster a sense of
closeness and unity, which are crucial elements in collaboration.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-idea">How did we come up with this idea?</h4>
<p>First, in collaboration with other groups, we identified the problems
encountered with Zoom, as well as the elements we would have missed if
the first day of the workshop had taken place through video calls.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Our group focused on the following key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-verbal clues</li>
<li>Small talk/side talk</li>
<li>Sensing the vibe of the other collaborators</li>
<li>Local separation</li>
<li>Chilled atmosphere</li>
<li>Sharing the same environment/experiencing the same environment as
the others</li>
</ul>
<p>From those points, we arrived at the realization that the most effective
way to enhance the dynamism of a video call would be to introduce
movement. This led us to the decision of eliminating the grid entirely.
Applying the &quot;morphological grid&quot; method, we explored various
potential actions to break free from the constraints of the grid. This
exercise generated numerous ideas, and we had to carefully consider the
form our project would take for the final presentation three days later.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-it-better-than-zoom">Why is it better than Zoom?</h4>
<p>Zoom avoids the sensation of forming a group by freezing us in one place and removing the sensation of being in space in relation to others. With <em>echo</em> the videocall experience is more human and interactive.</p>
<h4 id="what-other-existing-tools-could-it-be-compared-to-and-why-is-it-different">What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?</h4>
<p><em>echo</em> shares similarities with Spatial Chat as both platforms employ a
sound spatialization system. However, <em>echo</em> distinguishes itself by
offering a more minimalist and sensitive approach. While Spatial Chat
attempts to replicate a sense of reality, <em>echo</em> focuses on creating the
sensation of being part of a team rather than just occupying a virtual
open space.</p>

<h5 id="leoni-stein-enis-sentürk-philipp-roser">Leoni Stein, Enis Sentürk, Philipp Roser</h5>
<p>First, we began asking ourselves why eye-contact was not working and why
it was necessary for us. Soon we found out that side conversations have
a huge impact on the authenticity of meetings.</p>
<h4 id="why-we-have-no-eyecontact-during-zoom-calls">Why we have no eyecontact during Zoom calls</h4>
<ul>
<li>You see everyone at the same time</li>
<li>You look at yourself</li>
<li>You don&#39;t know if someone is looking at you</li>
<li>Every device has a different grid (of people)</li>
<li>Sometimes the camera is off</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-do-we-need-it">Why do we need it?</h4>
<ul>
<li>For direct feedback</li>
<li>For inclusion</li>
<li>For when you need to stay focused</li>

<li>To feel heard</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-might-we-questions">&quot;How might we&quot; questions</h4>
<ul>
<li>How might we make someone feel listened to?</li>
<li>How might we show two people that they look at each other?</li>
<li>How might we solve the problem of having side conversations without
disrupting the host?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/storyboard.png" alt="storyboard.png"></p>
<figcaption><i>eyesync</i> intentions</figcaption>


<p>The technology we want to use is called eye tracking. For this we use an
API called <em>webgazer</em>.</p>
<h3 id="react">re.act</h3>
<h4 id="roman-samarskyy-sarah-fütterling-tobias-reinhart">Roman Samarskyy, Sarah Fütterling, Tobias Reinhart</h4>
<h4 id="what-is-this-tool-for">What is this tool for?</h4>
<p><em>re.act</em> is an online meeting tool that enables participants to engage
in conversations based on their virtual location within a room. It
allows you to express your emotions and reactions to ongoing discussions
throughout the call.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-this-tool-for-1">Who is this tool for?</h4>
<p>The tool is designed for any kind of project group, teaching situations
and teams that require simultaneous collaboration.</p>
<h4 id="what-type-of-collaboration-is-it-for-sychroneousasynchroneous-collaborativecooperativeparticipative-1">What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?</h4>
<p>It is for real-time collaborations.</p>

<p>It makes it easier to connect with other people in the room.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-idea-1">How did we come up with this idea?</h4>
<p>The goal of the workshop was to reinvent digital communication and kill
a certain aspect of Zoom calls that was particularly annoying to most of
us.</p>
<p>We decided to focus on enhancing the ability to express reactions
because in a video call, it&#39;s challenging to convey your immediate
response to something that occurs during the call, unlike in a physical
room where others can hear your laughter or comments. We aimed to
provide a solution where participants can express their reactions
without disrupting the entire call or having them go unnoticed.</p>
<p>We began our project by collecting &#39;How might we...?&#39; questions and
systematically deconstructing them. We started by asking ourselves,
&#39;Why do we want to do this?&#39; and continued to delve deeper by
answering the question and subsequently asking ourselves &#39;Why do we
want to do this?&#39; again. Additionally, we explored another perspective
by inquiring, &#39;What&#39;s stopping us from doing this?&#39; This approach
helped us identify and understand the underlying problems.</p>
<p>Finally, we were able to summarize our findings in the following
questions:</p>
<p><img src="img/hmwfinal.png" alt="hmwfinal.png"></p>
<figcaption>Using "How might we...?" Questions</figcaption>

<p>We then conducted competitor analysis by researching other tools that
allow users to send reactions.</p>
<p><img src="img/competotor.png" alt="competotor.png"></p>
<figcaption>Use of emojis in existing tools</figcaption>

<p>Most of these tools enable users to send emojis as reactions. We then
proceeded to analyze numerous emojis, aiming to identify the ones that
carry the most universally recognized meanings.</p>
<p>Since most emojis have multiple meanings and can be easily
misunderstood, we embarked on a process to determine the most important
ones and their specific applications. After extensive discussions, we
carefully selected a small set of reaction emojis that we identified as
crucial. These emojis are categorized into three groups: action,
reaction, and emotion. The final set is visually represented with a grey
frame.</p>
<p><img src="img/emojiclassfinal.png" alt="emojiclassfinal.png"></p>
<figcaption>Use of emojis in existing tools</figcaption>

<p>The next step involved creating a concept that could be transformed into
a prototype. To achieve this, we developed a flowchart that illustrates
the process of sending reactions and provides an overview of how our
digital meetings function.</p>
<p>Then we sketched out first ideas of what our interface and reaction
process could look like visually.</p>
<p><img src="img/sketch3.png" alt="sketch3.png"></p>
<figcaption><i>re.act</i> mockup</figcaption>

<p>Our result is an online meeting tool that allows you to move freely in
the room and therefore to pick a seat and seat neighbors. You can talk
to the people you sit close to and hear those further away too but more
muted.</p>
<p>You can send reactions to a specific person, a group of people or the
whole room depending on where you drop the emoji after you dragged it
out of your selection.</p>
<p>You can receive reactions as well, and like any other tool it allows you
to do all that while listening to a presentation or watching a shared
screen.</p>

<figcaption><i>re.act</i> interface</figcaption>

<h4 id="why-is-it-better-than-zoom-1">Why is it better than Zoom?</h4>
<p>It offers a superior experience compared to Zoom as it closely mirrors
the dynamics of an in-person meeting. With numerous opportunities to
choose your actions, such as selecting your location in the virtual room
and deciding with whom you interact and share your reactions, it
provides a more immersive and realistic meeting environment.</p>
<h4 id="what-other-existing-tools-could-it-be-compared-to-and-why-is-it-different-1">What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?</h4>
<p>The tool uses all of the basic features that Zoom offers too but has
extensions that are connected to the real world. It is similar to the
app <em>wonder</em> which lets people walk to different places and chose
their talking partners as well.</p>

<p>Do the tools we use take on a different form when we create as a group
of people on the computer?</p>
<p>Personal computers were originally designed for individual use, with
established human-machine interfaces like the mouse or keyboard. These
interfaces, represented on the screen as mouse pointers or text cursors,
have undergone gradual changes over the past 50 years. However, with the
rise of web-based tools, we now have the ability to collaboratively edit
documents in real-time with others. Tools such as Figma, Miro, or Google
Docs display the presence of team members on the screen, but is this the
ultimate culmination of development? What other input patterns could be
possible and useful?</p>
<p>To explore these possibilities, Marc Guntow, an HfG teacher, organized
the workshop &quot;Collaborative Interaction Patterns,&quot; inviting students to
investigate input patterns in team situations and visualize their ideas
through prototypes and simulations.</p>

<figcaption><i>Authentic Emotion Capture</i> final presentation</figcaption>

<h4 id="what-is-this-tool-for">What is this tool for?</h4>
<p>In the digital collaboration era people tend to lack emotional
connection in the workspace. They are working with computers rather the
people using them. This tool makes it easier for co-workers to create
emotional connections, it helps start conversations both about work and
personal life and it lets you see authentic feedback of your work.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4>
<p>When you are viewing your co-worker&#39;s frame, motion capture system
starts detecting your facial expressions. When you have a distinctive
reaction, a picture is taken of you and posted in the frames corner. You
can add a comment to explain your reaction or make a face with a
stronger emotion to change it. You cannot delete your own reaction, but
others can.</p>
<h4 id="what-did-we-make">What did we make?</h4>
<p>Within four days we made a Figma file with different components that
could be added to Miro or Figjam. We also recorded a video with three
scenarios of the ways the tool could be used after drawing storyboards.
In the end we made an explaining poster with pictures of scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="what-type-of-collaboration-is-it-for-sychroneousasynchroneous-collaborativecooperativeparticipative">What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?</h4>
<p>This is made as a new feature for digital collaboration tools like Miro
and FigJam.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-impacts-the-collaboration">How does it impacts the collaboration?</h4>
<p>Digital collaboration is often very serious, and it lacks emotional
connection. With our solution people would give insight into their mood
and working spaces. By making the workspace more intimate by creating an
emotional connection between people. It also makes it less formal and
more fun so people would feel less anxious and alone while working from
distance.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-we-came-up-with-this-idea">How did we came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>At first, we came up with a few ideas which would be interesting to work
with concerning digital collaboration and cursor qualities. We thought
about gamification, making the workspace less formal and more
connecting. We then defined the problem we see in digital workspaces
that people lack emotional connection that they usually have because
they see face to face. We then started brainstorming about different
ideas and stuck with the one where a picture is taken of you
automatically to ensure authenticity.</p>

<h4 id="what-other-existing-tools-could-it-be-compared-to-and-why-is-it-different">What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?</h4>
<p>The solution can be compared to the stickers feature because they also
show what the other person is feeling. However, with our solution, the
reactions are real and authentic, they cannot be faked. In contrast,
while using the stickers, one can choose any reaction, even if they
don&#39;t feel genuinely that way. Seeing people&#39;s faces also makes you
more familiar with them, creating a more comfortable working
environment.</p>

<figcaption><i>FaceCursor</i> final presentation</figcaption>

<h4 id="what-is-this-tool-for-1">What is this tool for?</h4>
<p>FaceCursor is a short program that comes with a simulation of an
interface, incorporating a webcam into the mouse clicker. This tool has
the potential to reinvent the concept of video content by introducing
live elements, for example. Furthermore, it could serve as an add-on to
integrate into our operating systems, allowing us to move away from
simple video chat software and embrace a hybrid solution between
TeamViewer and Facetime (or the good old Skype).</p>
<h4 id="what-type-of-collaboration-is-it-for-sychroneousasynchroneous-collaborativecooperativeparticipative-1">What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?</h4>
<p>This tool is clearly designed for synchronous collaboration, distinct
from a simple <em>emoji</em> or <em>thumbs up</em> discussion. It has the
potential to be cooperative as well, with the inclusion of additional
features such as drag-and-drop or clipboard actions that involve
simultaneous user clicking. Currently, users have the ability to draw
directly on their <em>mouseelf</em>, extending the functionality of a paint
program to include live webcam capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-it-impacts-the-collaboration-1">How does it impacts the collaboration?</h4>
<p>FaceCursor clearly doesn&#39;t claim to be a huge innovation, but rather a
<em>cool</em> blending of several existing tools brought together.</p>
<h4 id="how-did-we-came-up-with-this-idea-1">How did we came up with this idea?</h4>
<p>The inspiration for this project came from our frequent use of Snap or
Instagram filters, but also with this ability to move your face anywhere
on the screen, when you are in a Facetime or Messenger call on a
smartphone (or similar device).  </p>
<h4 id="what-other-existing-tools-could-it-be-compared-to-and-why-is-it-different-1">What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?</h4>
<p>The difference with an overknown tool like Miro or Figma is the add of the mouse pointer with live camera on integrated, and the ability to get a &quot;real human&quot; interaction with it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-openings">Conclusion and openings</h2>
<p>This week was productive in terms of discussions, experiences, and
design. Students modeled numerous tools and explored a wide variety of
intentions that aim to discover new ways of interacting with each other.
We witnessed moments of skills and tool sharing among team members,
which was particularly interesting as it blurred the boundaries between
our school&#39;s pedagogies. The exchange between students allowed for a
porous integration of different educational approaches.</p>
<p>During this third and final workshop week, the teachers also had the
opportunity to discuss how to showcase all the work that had been done.
We considered different formats for disseminating the work and
ultimately decided on an exhibition in each school, with similar
content. This would involve video interviews with the students who
participated in the workshops, all answering the same set of questions
that we collectively wrote. Throughout the workshop, we received
informal feedback from the students, as they were the ones most directly
involved in the collaborative work. Recognizing the importance of their
perspectives and experiences, we felt it was essential to give their
testimonies and reflections on the subject of digital collaboration a
prominent place.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="many-hands-make-light-work">Many hands make light work</h4>
<p>Back in 2011, Andrew Blauvelt, a graphic designer and design theorist,
concluded that the relationship between graphic design and technology
has reached a new phase of maturity, redefining design that encompasses
the creation of new tools that enable others to practice design.<sup>1</sup>
This evolution has been built through gradual adoption of the power of
computers, more specifically of programming: &quot;We have to learn how to
create tools ourselves. After all, that&#39;s what computers are about: a
tool for creating tools.&quot;<sup>2</sup> The ability of designers to produce their
own tools has enhanced a transformation of practices that takes the form
of a seemingly paradoxical double movement: appropriating to share
better.</p>
<p>For designers, taking ownership of their tool production is a way of
liberating themselves and asserting their independence against the
monopolistic position that Adobe holds over the tools of the design
profession. This claim sometimes even goes as far as advocating for a
level of autonomy close to self-sufficiency or even autarchy, which
requires a deep understanding and complete mastery of the technical
chain, usually necessitating the acquisition of programming skills.</p>
<p>However, this autarkic approach to appropriation is accompanied by a
strong desire for sharing, openness, collaboration and versatility,
whether between designers, with clients or with the public. This
fruitful duality is well summarized by Anthony Masure when he speaks
about the work of the collective OSP: &quot;Many hands make light work<sup>3</sup>,&quot;
and it is frequently affirmed and displayed in the discourse of
designers themselves. But what tools are we talking about? And what kind
of collaborations? What are their effects on design practices and
outputs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Redefining the profession: How collaborative tools revolutionize
 design by shifting from the creation of unique, finalized forms to
 an endless factory of possibilities to be explored through
 collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>The act of developing collaborative tools for production in design
shifts the focus from creating final objects or forms to creating tools
that are inherently collaborative in nature. Beyond digital realms, we
observe the same inclination among designers to produce tools, sometimes
even on paper, that will be used by others to create the final forms.
Why is there such an enthusiasm among designers for tool production? I
believe it&#39;s a matter of designers reappropriating a technical expertise
that distinguishes them from those who can &quot;only use&quot; traditional
digital tools, which have become accessible and usable by everyone. &quot;At
the end of the day, if what you produce can be done by anyone with a
computer, why would we need a designer? In other words, we adopt the
business language and ask: as a designer, what is your added
value?<sup>4</sup>&quot;</p>
<p>Today, the true power lies less in the production of forms, which has
become widely accessible to everyone, and more in the creation of tools
that will then structure the production of these forms. Thus, while the
designer seemingly relinquishes their prerogatives over forms, they
actually retain the right to define their outlines and conditions, the
realm of latent possibilities. Incidentally, developing tools shifts
designer&#39;s work by requiring additional skills and prompting new
questions: How can this tool be made usable by non-programmers? How can
it be easily reappropriated/readopted by those who know how to program?
How can the tool be maintained, nurtured and evolved? These are new
areas of expertise that disrupt the fundamentals of the profession.</p>
<p>In terms of the produced forms, the development of tools promotes
engendering of multiples responses to each problem. Unique and
definitive forms are no longer the sole focus, as developing tools
implies their repeated use by multiple individuals. Collaborative tools
usually enable the creation of a multitude of forms, serving as a series
of variations around a single theme. This possibility aligns well with
the nature of the digital technology. It doesn&#39;t cost more to produce
and display an infinite number of different forms online. On the
contrary, the attention economy demands a constant abundance of content
to be shared on social networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open-Closed: How do collaborative tools bring into play limits that
 promote diversity of forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically, the digitization of design tools has led to their
universalization. Global monopolies have emerged around a few companies
that produce software with a universal and all-encompassing purpose.
Whether in Japan, South Africa, or Europe, we now design using the same
tools. Regardless of the project, context or designer, we can always use
the same software because they promise -theoretically- to enable the
creation of all possible forms.</p>
<p>On the contrary, many digital tools produced by designers are small,
highly distinctive tools, often custom-made or derived from an existing
base and adapted to a new context. These tools are distinctive not only
because they may become irrelevant and unusable outside of their
context, but also because they typically have a much narrower range of
formal capabilities. Very often, collaborative digital tools introduce a
certain number of constraints and provide a limited number of parameters
that can then be varied. By offering a narrow infinity of possibilities
to explore, the tools created by designers defy the infinite potential
of universalist software, which has often fueled the homogenization of
productions. This is precisely because the restriction or explicit
channeling of possibilities enables the production of a multitude of
different proposals while ensuring a certain graphic coherence. It is
also this closure that allows for the production of unique forms that
are always contextualized and, therefore, constantly renewed. Taken
individually, these tools often have a recognizable aesthetic, a sense
of déjà vu, but it is through their multiplication that closed tools can
claim a certain formal openness in the form of contextual diversity.</p>
<p>The interest in producing closed tools is not solely limited to the
formal aspect. The more tools have a universal purpose and a large,
permanent user base, the more attention, maintenance, bugfix, progress,
and feature additions will be required in order to meet new emerging
needs. Restricting the possibilities and staying within the context
allows designer to free themselves from these maintenance issues and
align the tool production with a more traditional process of creation:
one project equals one tool, just as we used to have one project equals
one form or a series of forms. Once the project is completed, it can be
archived, and one can move on to the next. The traditional lifecycle of
tools, especially digital ones, is often different, and if we wish for
the renewal of a tool, limiting it also allows a necessary end of cycle.
Even though they are formally closed, each tool retains an inherent
openness that allows those with programming skills to modify them,
enabling potential adaptations to different contexts. This process
reopens a new realm of possibilities that is simultaneously infinite and
constrained. However, the open nature of coding, should not hide the
fact that it is rarely sufficient for genuine sharing and true
appropriation to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different nuances of collaboration: In what ways do various forms
of collaboration manifest themselves in tools?</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating tools only makes sense if others use them. Considering tools
from a collaborative perspective is therefore evident, and this
relationship has notably emerged in design thanks to the ethics of
open-source software, which is based on sharing. Participation has been
a part of art and design for a long time, dating back to historically
marginalized and activist practices such as Scandinavian participatory
design. This approach advocated for a political stance in designing
digital tools, involving collaboration with workers and challenging
employers<sup>5</sup>. Nowadays, the demand for collaboration with the public
has become ubiquitous in design<sup>6</sup> and is advocated as a mode of action
by many designers. Relying on collaboration helps to avoid definitive
proposals, which are sometimes perceived as too assertive, undemocratic,
and therefore lacking legitimacy. It also allows designers to free
themselves from the responsibility of form, because for designers who
produce tools or collaboration protocols, &quot;forms are not the subject of
their concerns and discourse<sup>7</sup>.&quot;</p>
<p>But what kind of collaboration are we talking about? There are several
ways to collaborate, ranging from contribution to cooperation, sharing,
participation and perhaps even exploitation. The development of digital
tools in design today presents at least two distinct aspects, as the
collaboration between designers and developers differs significantly
from the collaboration aimed at the general public.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll begin with collaboration between designers. Within the ecosystem
of designer-tool producers, many collectives can be found where
collaborative tools are used to facilitate collaborative work. Either
designers collaborate in the creation process of tools, or some develop
them for others to utilize. More widely, for some tools with greater
ambitions, such as paged.js library, communities of designers are
formed, who are often both users and contributors. Collaboration between
designers can also take the form of variation or forking. In this case,
the designer leaves open the possibility for others to take up, develop,
or adapt their work. Also in this case, we&#39;re talking about adapting
practices from programming culture, even though, when it comes to
variation based on existing work, one can draw a connection with older
practices such as remakes and variations that are widely used in
typography, for example<sup>8</sup>. What is also new perhaps is that designers
today explicitly call for an appropriation of their work and often seek
to facilitate it through documentation. However, these forms of
collaboration are only accessible to a small elite of designers as they
require programming skills that are far from being democratized.</p>
<p>The second type of collaboration is the participation of the &quot;public&quot; in
the creation process. Rather than true collaboration, the term commonly
used in this case is participation, which extends far beyond the sphere
of digital tools in the field of design. Yann Aucompte observes this
phenomenon in certain forms of exhibition, for example: &quot;Attending to
exhibitions is an active contribution by the public, as they, along with
the graphic designer, seek to sharpen a critical culture [...] The
exhibition is seen as a space for the public&#39;s engagement and
participation. The spectator of this kind of exhibition is not passive;
they contribute to the creation of a collective critical culture<sup>9</sup>.&quot;
When we talk about participation, we refer to inclusion in a process of
creation, but we immediately grasp the asymmetry that exists between
stakeholders. In this context, the designer becomes &quot;a producer or
orchestrator of frameworks, systems and actions that allow design to
exist. They have lost their traditional role as the sole creator of the
work; this role has been usurped by &quot;contributors,&quot; sometimes
numbering in the thousands<sup>10</sup>. This type of participation is sometimes
aimed at the tool&#39;s client and offers them a certain level of autonomy,
for example, by allowing them to create variations of visuals by
manipulating the parameter(s) provided in the software. Compared to the
active and egalitarian collaboration between designer-programmers,
public participation generally takes the form of a more limited
involvement, utilizing the tool through a few predetermined actions that
enable the exploration of the space of possible formal variations. The
different proposals created are usually placed and presented at the same
level because it is their abundance that makes sense, rather than each
individual contribution being taken separately. This participation is
also time-limited, taking the form of workshops or guided performances.
This form of collaboration mediated by the tool has its own logic
because an audience confronted with a new creative tool cannot be
instantly trained in design practice or spend hours mastering a tool
that they will often only use once. Supervising and supporting usage
through workshops also alleviate some of the tedious work involved in
designing a long-term digital tool, which requires meticulous
fine-tuning of every ergonomic detail to facilitate independent learning
and eliminate bugs.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to question what this participation represents.
According to Duhem, demanding to participate, even with the best
intentions, can lead to control and exploitation of the participants
rather than emancipation<sup>11</sup>, including in what he refers to as
alternative design. What agency is given to the users of these tools?
Are they encouraged to &quot;participate&quot; in the same way as click workers,
who can only operate within a limited set of choices and remain
anonymous behind the tool&#39;s designer? Creating a framework, a set of
graphical constraints utilized by others to generate final forms, is not
a novel concept. Indeed, it is even the principle behind graphic
charters. However, the creation and use of these systems were not
introduced as collaborative.</p>
<p>Speaking of collaborative creation tools implies considering this
dichotomy and delving into the mechanics of collaboration, which
indicates different ways of getting involved. Collaborative creation
tools are accompanied by a new divide between those who know how to
create or manipulate tools, and those who can only use them. I believe
there is still a need to explore ways to bridge this divide.</p>

<p>Here I am on the train, on my way to Karlsruhe, Germany. I am going
there to give some classes with Raphael Bastide<sup>1</sup> at the University
of Fine Arts and Design<sup>2</sup>. We decided to be cheerful and named our
seminar<sup>3</sup> <em>A party to print</em>, imagining a festive atmosphere while
preparing a new publication. We prepared nothing, so we have no idea
about the outcome, and we don&#39;t necessarily want to predict. We will
create this experience together with the students.</p>
<p>When they ask me, &quot;And you? What do you do?&quot;, I don&#39;t answer plainly, &quot;I
am a graphic and interaction designer&quot;, which most of the time signifies
nothing for the people I am interacting with. Instead, I try to explain
a current project I am working on. I should say, &quot;I am doing a seminar
called <em>A Party to Print</em> in Karlsruhe&quot;. Then, I can talk about
horizontal learning, collaborative projects, creating and using open
source tools, alternative ways of publishing, experimenting, cooking,
and savior syndrome, search for meaning in life.</p>
<p>Rather than presenting my extensive theories on Digital Tools for
Creative Collaboration, I prefer telling you five experiences of
&quot;working together&quot; based on tools designed for digital collaboration (or
not); that made us feel useful (or not), happy (or not), angry (or not).
Most importantly, they made us think while doing and do while thinking.
Each of these experiences, in its own way, questioned the various ways
in which the introduction of collaborative digital tools modifies human
relationships and our ways of working together in a defined context. At
times, these experiences have exposed us to the limitations of our
tools. However, the totality of these narratives shows that successes
and failures are never due to the tool itself, but to the way it is
being utilized, presented, introduced, and shared. They depend on the
tacit agreement among the parties involved in using the tool and the
objectives established together (or not).</p>

<p>We have just spent the entire night at the office of Museum of Natural
History in Bern, Switzerland; printing, folding and binding 100 copies
of the publication called <em>Frankenstein Revisited</em>. We are doing an art
residency since couple of days at the museum with Piero<sup>4</sup>,
James<sup>5</sup>, Anne<sup>6</sup>, Catherine<sup>7</sup> et An<sup>8</sup> accompanied by
stuffed animals<sup>9</sup>. We<sup>10</sup> were invited for the festival called
<em>Mad Scientist</em> organized by Roland Fisher. Piero, James, Anne,
Catherine and An came with their chatbots<sup>11</sup> inspired by the book
<em>Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus</em> by Mary Shelley<sup>12</sup>. On my
side, I preferred <em>Publishing Jockey Machine</em><sup>13</sup> (or <em>PJ Machine</em>), a
real interface connected to a web program, developed for the occasion.
The project consists of creating a publication in three days, including
the group in the whole creative process (writing, iconography, layout,
printing and binding). The content will be the discussions with
chatbots, contextual texts in the form of letters<sup>14</sup> and photographs
taken in the museum. After a discussion, we agreed as a group on the
basic principles of publishing (format, binding, chaptering and
planning). I set up a local shared folder which will include all the
content organized in folders. Each folder represents a double page of
publication; each is free to add a content; text or image. Any computer
connected to the <em>PJ Machine</em> functions as a workstation for the layout.
I created a simple graphic charter: one size and one typography for the
text, one size and one typography for the titles. All the rest is done
by <em>PJ Machine</em>. This box with the big arcade buttons works like a
control keyboard. Each button has a designated function. It is possible
to relocate texts and images, increase or decrease the space between
words, mix images together or highlight recurring words. Each member of
the group lay out their texts once they have been completed. 
<em>PJ Machine</em> is very simple to use however it uses interactions we are not quite used to, which causes some lucky graphic accidents. Concentration
is at maximum during the layout. (see image: 04-pjmachine_in-use2.jpg).</p>
<p>When you are satisfied with the outcome, a button allows you to export
it in PDF format, ready for printing. The group members take turns using
<em>PJ Machine</em> and double-page spreads are exported in a random order. We
print all the completed PDFs (resulting in total 55 double-page
spreads). We place them on the floor to put them on order. And finally,
we see the publication in its entirety.</p>
<p>Each of us participated in every stage of the edition&#39;s creation
process, however only in certain parts. Publication seems like an
organized and coherent piece. I am compiling a final pdf for print.</p>
<p>The week ends with the opening of <em>Mad Scientist Festival</em>. We watch a
ballet of stuffed animal drones and drink mojitos prepared by a robot.
We experimented, had a good laugh, and we are delighted to have done
this work together.</p>

<p>We are on the last day of the conference named <em>Art, Literature and
Social Networks<sup>15</sup></em> at Château de Cerisy-La-Salle, and it&#39;s time
to debrief. We gather together at the great hall of the castle. The
question is quite simple: &quot;What did you think of the conference?&quot;. The
first person intervenes, criticizing strongly the <em>DONC</em> experience.
&quot;What an idea to propose a digital project connected to internet in such
a place, in the middle of nature, where there is hardly any WiFi or 4G.
We could have been entirely disconnected. But instead, we found
ourselves trapped in a digital experiment, faced with this one hacker
who ruined the week for us.&quot;<sup>16</sup> For an hour or so, all conversations
revolved around this. They attacked me, Raphaël<sup>17</sup> and Louise<sup>18</sup>
as much as they attacked the hacker. I discretely rejoice over the
results of our experiment. We had wanted to create a social network
during this week. Over the course of five days, we have seen all the
awkward situations possible that come with social networking and online
open participation. Images shared without consent, trolling, anonymity,
identity theft, spam, even a complete hack of the system, which resulted
in an absolute anger among the participants. We created a collaborative
system of misery.</p>
<p>We arrived to the castle of Cerisy-La-Salle in the beginning of the week
to participate in the conference named <em>Art, Literature and Social Networks</em>. When I say, &quot;we&quot;, I talk about the participants, artists and
academics. The place is incredible. Raphaël, Louise and me, we came here
with a special task in head for this week: to build up an experimental
documentation system for the conference, enabling the creation of an
almost real-time publication. Beforehand, we decided to create a tool
based on a mailing list, and we called it <em>DONC</em>. All content sent by
e-mail to this list is received by all the subscribers and is
automatically added to a web page formatted in HTML and CSS<sup>19</sup>,
serving as a basis for publication. Every half-day, we print the new
pages for the publication. We display them on large tables in a crowded
room (which also serves as the cocktail area). We provide pens, duct
tapes, markers, pencils etc. ready for manual commentary to be written
in these pages. The pages are then scanned with a smartphone to create a
printable PDF.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the first day of the conference and we present our project. All
participants are registered by default on the mailing list of <em>DONC</em>,
nothing is mandatory, if someone doesn&#39;t wish to participate, we remove
them from the list. Two or three people decide to not participate.
Fairly soon after, the publication fills up, and emails pour in. Images
from conference are sent in, as well as short texts, jokes, riddles,
long texts, text of the previous presentation and so on. All the
subscribers participate actively. Printed pages are filled with
comments, with words that are crossed out, pieces that are cut out and
crushed. In the evening, when the cocktail hour is well underway, we
find ourselves surrounded by half-witted jokes. On the second day, some
of the e-mails seem to be encrypted and the Cerisybot<sup>20</sup> appears.
The publication continues to be filled up with making-of images, photos
of Cerisy, advices and generated texts. On May 24, the Cerisybot sends
another e-mail with a subject line called &quot;«[VIRUS] I &lt;3 YOU&quot;.</p>
<p>Identity thefts start to appear. Some emails are sent from the email
addresses of participants who are not the actual authors. This leads to
a few tensions. More spam texts arrive in the evening of May 24th, and
we receive the same emails multiple times. An image of a train, a text
that begins with &quot;Queen of Egypt, goddess of Nubia,&quot; and some others.
These e-mails are completely anonymous. On the morning of May 26th,
all <em>DONC</em> participants wake up to find their e-mail inbox full of spam.
Rumors circulate that there is a hacker within the group, and a few
individuals are suspected and even denounced. One of the participants
storms into the breakfast room, furious, with his computer under his
arm, saying, &quot;You broke my computer!&quot; I examine the so-called
&quot;broken&quot; computer, and its email inbox is full; the user has never
emptied the trash. I empty the trash, and just like that, it&#39;s fixed.
Without a &quot;thank you&quot; and still furious (probably his ego bruised by
his technical incapacity), he leaves, slamming the door, and we don&#39;t

<p>But who is this hacker?</p>
<p>Tensions rise.</p>
<p>Between May 25th and May 26th, the mailing list receives an email that
causes the <em>DONC</em> system to crash. Tired of the complaints and criticism
regarding the experience, we decide to stop it, claiming that the system
is irreparable. From a small study room in the castle stables, Raphael,
Louise, and I send an email to the <em>DONC</em> mailing list:</p>
<p><em>Dear participants,</em></p>
<p><em>DONC system has been hacked, we regret to inform you that the experiment ends now. After this email, you will be unsubscribed from the mailing list, and your emails will no longer be addressed by DONC.</em>
<em>You will be kept informed of the project&#39;s evolution.</em>
<em>We thank you for your (very) active participation, which contributed to the success of this project.</em></p>
<p><em>The DONC team</em></p>
<p>We take advantage of this interruption to finalize the publication,
print it, and bind it. It will remain printed in a few copies that will
never be distributed<sup>21</sup>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sitting at the counter of the bar of <em>Gaîte Lyrique</em> in Paris.
Romain<sup>22</sup> et Anne<sup>23</sup> arrive with middle schoolers from the
cooperative school of Collège Jean-Pierre Timbaud in Bobigny. They are
here to present the project they have worked on together during the
year. Lyna, Ambre and Christelle<sup>24</sup> present <em>Chépa, Le Journal Pour Tou.te.s</em> imagined, written, illustrated and laid out by the
students of the class. The presentation ends with a distribution of the
journal, and the students, proud of their work, run throughout the
building and into the street to offer what they have created.</p>
<p>Since 2015, with Pauline<sup>25</sup> and Louis<sup>26</sup>, under the title of
&quot;l&#39;Atelier des Chercheurs<sup>27</sup>,&quot; we are developing, among other
things, a software called do•doc. Designed to
document and create narratives from practical activities, do•doc is a
composite, free, and modular tool that allows you to capture media
(photos, videos, sounds, and stop-motion), edit them, lay them out, and
publish them. Its composite nature allows it to be reconfigured to be as
well-suited as possible to the situation in which it is deployed.
do•doc includes a local software version and an online version. It has
been built using web languages, specifically utilizing tools that enable
real-time collaboration such as Node.js<sup>28</sup>, Electron<sup>29</sup>, and
Socket.io<sup>30</sup>.</p>
<p>With the intention of building this software in specific contexts, we
conduct workshops in educational institutions to test the software and
add features based on identified needs.</p>
<p>The project started with the students of Jean-Pierre Timbaud Middle
School on September 19, 2018. We meet approximately once a week to
collectively create a journal from A to Z, exploring the themes of the
<em>Computer Grrrls</em><sup>31</sup> exhibition. With Anne and Romain, the two
teachers supervising the project, we decided to apply a horizontal
pedagogy, a guided <em>laissez-faire</em> approach. We did not impose any
decisions, as everyone was responsible and an organizer in their own
right.</p>
<p>The first workshops are dedicated to discussion and debate. The floor is
given to the students. For each discussion, there are two volunteers:
one facilitates the conversation, while another takes notes on the
board. I ask them fundamental questions: what type of sexism do you
experience as teenagers? Are your extracurricular activities
gender-biased? Can you mention any movies, video games, or music that
you find sexist?</p>
<p>But also technical and logistical questions: What is a journal? What
content should be in the journal? What topic should be chosen? How do
you organize you work? How many copies should be made? How do we
distribute it? What should we name it?</p>
<p>Starting with these conversations, three groups are formed around three
themes: street harassment, gender in professions, and girls in video
games. The students begin writing the articles on do•doc in small
groups. All of this takes place in the computer room equipped with old
Windows computers and a questionable internet connection. do•doc is used
locally, and all the computers are connected via Wi-Fi to a central
computer that acts as a server. This way, all the content is gathered in
one place, offline.</p>
<p>All decisions are made as a group. We discuss the layout, with each
group advocating for their ideas, and compromises are reached. One
session is dedicated to creating photo illustrations in the school and
in the streets of Bobigny with Frédéric Danos, while another session
focuses on building a a do•doc<sup>32</sup> station at the fablab of
<em>Carrefour du Numérique de la Cité des Sciences</em> (Paris). The final
sessions (a bit chaotic due to the temperamental computers) are
dedicated to the layout of the articles on do•doc, allowing all
participants to finalize the journal together.</p>
<p>Despite the technical difficulties related to the outdated equipment in
schools, the challenges of managing a group of teenagers, disagreements,
laziness, the extended timeline of the project, fatigue, insults, and
spelling mistakes, we collectively managed to create this journal,
printed in 1000 copies.</p>
<p>Epilogue: During this workshop, I kept a log after each session, which
can be accessed at this address:

<h3 id="lorient">Lorient</h3>
<p>Since March 29, I&#39;ve been in Lorient at EESAB<sup>34</sup> for a
web2print<sup>35</sup> with Roman<sup>36</sup>. It&#39;s Wednesday, which means it&#39;s
time for the &quot;matinale&quot;, an improvised and experimental radio show that
takes place live and in public from 7am to 9am at the Vanilla
café<sup>37</sup> in Pré-Saint-Gervais (93). I have been co-hosting this show
with dns and hrbr for nearly three years. However, today I am in
Lorient. I scheduled a meeting at 7am with strd, rmn, and clr<sup>38</sup> at
the corner of the street near my hotel. It&#39;s still dark outside. I
start the audio streaming application on my mobile phone. The microphone
of my phone captures the ambient sound and sends it (streams) to my
mount point on the IceCast<sup>39</sup> server of ∏Node<sup>40</sup>. My live stream
&quot;goes up&quot; and appears on the homepage of p-node.org. jdsk, comfortably
settled at her home, can listen with a 15-second delay<sup>41</sup> to the
audio stream broadcasted by my phone and mix it with the live audio
stream produced at the same time by dns, hrb, and their guests from the
temporary radio studio at Vanilla Café. It&#39;s 7 am, and my phone calmly
captures the ambient sound of the quiet streets of Lorient while strd
and rmn grab a takeaway coffee. We start our stroll, heading towards the
fishing port. Our destination is the sandwich shack that&#39;s open at all
hours, and perhaps we&#39;ll have the chance to interview some fishermen
who stayed a little late at the fish market. 500km away, at the Vanilla
Café, a lot is happening, but we are clueless since we don&#39;t listen to
it. We blindly participate in a sound mix, and we don&#39;t need necessarily
to worry about this collaboration; chance takes care of things for us,
helped by our jdsk on the mixing tables. We do as we please, at two
distinct points, to create a whole. A kind of altruistic selfishness.</p>
<p>The smell of industrial shrimp from the frozen products factory
accompanies us during the walk. We discuss, comment, interview, and
describe. We finish the two-hour broadcast at La Base, the nautical port
of Lorient.</p>
<p>So, this live morning show, broadcasted from Lorient and Le
Pré-Saint-Gervais, acts like a cloud carved by the wind and returns
home, it slides like words flowing through the airstream, like something
messing up your hair when you&#39;re asleep and dreaming of having your
hair done, mixed by jdsk, hosted by grcn, hrbr, dns, and accompanied by
their guests.</p>
<p>Epilogue: To listen to this show, you can visit the website of Radio PSG
Matin.</p>
<p>There, you will find the recording of the morning show that took place
on March 29, 2021, along with other similar radio experiments that have
occurred at Radio PSG Matin.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-train-from-saint-etienne-to-paris">On the train from Saint-Etienne to Paris</h3>
<p>Last night, at the auditorium of ESADSE<sup>43</sup>, I gave a conference
entitled <em>Long-Distance Relationship (or Not)</em>. This talk aimed to
explore the question of collaborative digital tools operating in the
same time and space, usually functioning offline. For this conference, I
used a tool called <em>baking.js</em><sup>44</sup>. It was designed and developed in
2015 with Angeline<sup>45</sup> for the ELIF seminar at ENSBA<sup>46</sup>. This
tool was created to facilitate collaborative presentations involving
multiple speakers. It allows for real-time manipulation of media and
text across multiple devices (computers, tablets, smartphones). Its
functionality is inspired by a stack of images that can be browsed and
explored, enhanced with digital features such as zoom, fullscreen
display, and hypertext. <em>baking.js</em> also allows the audience to connect to
the application through a local network and contribute to the conference
by adding texts or images. Thus, I tested this participatory system for
the first time yesterday as part of the &quot;Digital Tools for Creative
Collaboration&quot; project. At the beginning of the conference, I invited
the students present in the room to connect to the Wi-Fi and visit the
provided IP address to comment, hack, troll, make live suggestions, and
interact with the presentation. In less than a minute, the presentation
is disrupted, the images prepared for the conference are moved to
different corners of the page, memes or images generated by AI are added
on top. A sound recording plays in a loop. The presentation is
completely trolled<sup>47</sup> from the start. The audience is destabilized.
The public continues these disruptions sporadically throughout the hour
and a half of the presentation, without ever discussing their
contributions. When I ask, &quot;What is this? Do you want to talk about
it?&quot; There is no response (perhaps I didn&#39;t insist enough). Some
collaborations seem political, such as capturing an article about the
potential misappropriation of funds by the former director of the Cité
du Design, or a text titled &quot;A €1.4 million hole in the budget of the
Cité du Design.&quot; In the end, I proposed an anonymous collaborative tool
where all contributions are anonymous. The first contribution was
disruption, making it difficult for the presenter with jokes, and
trolling. There were political claims without any clear stance, letting
the media speak on their behalf. Does anyone take responsibility
IRL<sup>48</sup>? Does anyone openly discuss these issues? Everything seems to
occur online, and I continue with my presentation. Is this what true
participation looks like? Is this what it means to collaborate? Is this
what it means to create common resources together? Is this the essence
of sharing knowledge? Perhaps the problem lies in my role as an expert
speaking alone to an audience, adopting the position of a teacher
addressing students.</p>
<p>An uprising against a certain authority, a &quot;hey, look at me, I&#39;m here
too,&quot; diverting attention, disrupting focus.</p>
<p>Perhaps this initial reaction is linked to our digital usage, both as
consumers and producers of content.</p>
<p>However, <em>baking.js</em> was designed to be participatory, blurring the line
between the stage and the audience, with the goal of engaging the
audience in the presentation. It encourages daring interruptions, adding
images, and provoking debates and discussions. In the face of trolling,
wouldn&#39;t it be necessary to interrupt the presentation and encourage
discussion and comments? Does this align with the true essence of
collaboration? Is a misunderstanding equivalent to a quid pro quo?</p>

        <h2 id="ourcollaborativetools">ourcollaborative.tools</h2>
<p>As part of the DTCC project, our goal was to create a publication that
would serve as a long-term tool; a device that synthesizes our research
conducted in collaboration at ESADSE and that would be useful for
designers, artists, students, and academics.</p>
<p>At first, we envisioned a toolkit, but ultimately, we conceived of a
platform called <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>. This platform serves as an
online design research publication, a participatory archive, and a
pedagogical tool. It features a catalog of collective artistic projects
involving digital tools, emphasizing situated responses rather than
generic solutions. Additionally, it includes articles that provide
critical thinking to explore alternative uses and approaches in creative
collaboration.</p>
<p>The platform is intended for use by designers and artists, whether they
are students or professionals, who are interested in topics such as
collaboration, cooperation, contribution, participation, the creative
process, free software (FOSS), computer development, and visual arts.</p>
<p>All the projects listed in this catalog contribute to the development of
commons through digital artistic devices. The artists and designers who
create these projects are, each in their own way, establishing
frameworks to facilitate collaborations. These collaborations may
involve peers, experts from other disciplines, classrooms, inhabitants
of specific territories, and even non-human entities. We are
particularly intrigued by the ambivalent nature of these productions,
which serve as both artworks and tools.</p>
<p>However, our goal extends beyond merely archiving projects. We also aim
to document collective practices and examine how artists and designers
utilize, combine, and even modify existing tools, as well as develop new
ones that align with their unique working methods, so that these tools
can be adapted to align with their specific working methods and not the
other way around. To achieve this, we will curate a collection of
articles and a mediagraphy that provide a critical perspective on
digital collaboration and the creation of situated tools for artistic
purposes.</p>
<p>By interconnecting projects and articles through shared concepts and
data, this participatory archive serves as a bridge between artworks,
narratives of creative processes, theoretical insights, and critical
thinking.</p>
<p>We are continuously working on its design and editorial structure and we
will continue for some time. With a small team and through workshops, we
would like to push this object as far as possible in order to really
make it a tool that could be used for several purposes. This project is
in progress, here is an abstract of our intentions and current work for
<em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>.</p>

<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>
<p>Each project is presented in the form of a sheet that provides the
title, description, year of creation if it exists, the author(s), a link
to the source, usage, temporality, the technical environment and
pictures of the project. We are still thinking about other entries we
could add, like tools used to make it, licenses, and programming
languages.</p>
<p>Notions are also associated with each project as tags that connects them
with articles related.</p>

<h4 id="articles">Articles</h4>
<p>We invited several academics and practitioners to tell us about their
visions of creative collaboration through the filter of their own
professional experience. We asked them to write a text as close as
possible to their sensibilities to build a corpus of situated articles,
in relation to our subject. These texts are either stories of projects
presented from a critical perspective, or theoretical texts linked to
the authors&#39; research work.</p>
<p>Projects and notions are associated with each text to create an
ecosystem of relationships within the various contents of
<em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a shortlist of the contributions that we know will be published
on <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garcin, S. (2023). Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration:
Logbook.</li>
<li>Maudet, N. (2023). Appropriate to Better Share: Digital tools for

A Potential Role for Trees.</li>
<li>ooooo (2023). From Feminist Servers to Feminist Federation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notions">Notions</h4>
<p>We intend to enhance the platform with a lexicon of notions related to
our research topic. Each concept will be accompanied by its definition,
creating a common vocabulary base aimed at engaging a non-initiated
audience. This index of notions will also serve as a search filter,
allowing users to click on a concept to open a list of associated
projects and articles.</p>

<figcaption><i>ourcollaborative.tools</i> index of notions</figcaption>

<h4 id="ressources">Ressources</h4>
<p>We want this catalog to be as rich as possible. Due to financial
constraints and to further enrich the research conducted within this
project, we have decided to incorporate a mediagraphy. The mediagraphy
will consist of references to articles, books, websites, and other
relevant sources that offer diverse perspectives on the subject of
digital tools for collaboration in art and design practices. We will
continuously update this library with suggestions from guest authors,
students, teachers involved in the project, as well as contributions
from external sources. The mediagraphy follows the APA model to ensure
compatibility with current research norms and academic formats.</p>

<p>We have made the deliberate choice to allocate a significant portion of
the platform to visual content, allowing ample space for interface
illustrations and screenshots of the indexed projects. This decision was
made to highlight and appreciate their formal design. In addition, we
aim to provide generous visual support within the articles, continuously
bridging the gap between practice and theory.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-built">How is it built?</h3>
<p>We invited Benjamin Dumond from Bonjour Monde studio. As a graphic and
interaction designer, Benjamin was responsible for building the
website&#39;s graphic identity and developing the interface&#39;s logic. Since
we consider <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> as a design object in itself, we
aimed for a strong and distinctive identity.</p>
<p>We then collaborated on designing the user experience. The development
and editorial work are being carried out by our Random() team to ensure
ongoing evolution and maintenance in the coming years.</p>
<p><em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> is built with the Django framework, it&#39;s
well-suited for content-rich platforms and can be easily scaled
according to future developments. The entire platform is exclusively
built using free software, including the interface design created with
Inkscape, and of course, the development of the platform using Django. All the source code will be made available in open access retrospectively.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h3>
<p>The platform is designed to facilitate the creation of meaningful
connections between its various components. The overarching goal is to
provide users with a wide range of options for exploring the content.
Additionally, the platform aims to evolve into a participatory archive
that encourages contributions from anyone interested in enriching its
content.</p>
<h4 id="explore">Explore</h4>
<p>With <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>, our ambition is to create a rich and
dynamic database of content for users to explore. The platform is
designed to ensure that each element is interconnected with others.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways users can browse the content:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entry page serves as the index of projects, prioritizing visual
elements such as pictures. As well as the pages dedicated for
&quot;Articles&quot;, &quot;Authors&quot;, &quot;Notions&quot;, and &quot;Media&quot;, each
providing access to the corresponding content categories.</li>
<li>Each element within the platform is accompanied by associated data,
including the date of creation, usage, temporality, etc. These data
points also serve as filters, and clicking on them leads to a
curated list of related content.</li>
<li>Users can also utilize the search feature to explore projects,
notions, and articles based on specific keywords or terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> is designed to empower users to
navigate through the information by allowing them to customize their own
pathways and explore the data according to their preferences.</p>
<h4 id="participate">Participate</h4>
<p>For now, we are feeding the platform with a curated selection of
projects, articles, notions, and resources from our own collection, as
well as contributions from a select group of artists, designers, and
academics within our network.</p>
<p>However, <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> is designed as a participatory archive
and will soon be open to proposals from a wider community. </p>
<p>Symbolically, it aims to engage a community of creators who are motivated by the idea of creative collaboration.</p>
<p>In order to maintain editorial coherence, we are in the process of
deciding how we want to moderate the platform. We are currently
considering the implementation of participation guidelines and the
development of a submission form for content that would require
validation before publication.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-come-next">What will come next?</h3>
<p>From the beginning, <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> has been designed as a
pedagogical tool to be used in our schools. The next step will involve
testing it with students. Initially, we intend to use it for research
work, leveraging its potential as a participative archive with rich
content to explore and contribute to. Furthermore, as a constantly
evolving tool, we aim to involve students in improving it from both
technical and editorial perspectives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a dynamic database with interoperability, we envision
<em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> taking on various forms such as web-to-print
publications, exhibitions, and more. We would like to explore these
possibilities with students through collaborative curatorial, editorial,
and design projects.</p>
<p>It is of utmost importance to us that this platform does not become a
static archive but remains a malleable entity in constant evolution. To
achieve this, <em>ourcollaborative.tools</em> will be passed from hand to hand,
it will grow, mutate, and be forked through classes and workshops.</p>

        <h1 id="making-exhibitions-as-a-collective-and-pedagogical-practice">Making Exhibitions as a Collective and Pedagogical Practice</h1>
<p>The idea of exhibition as a pedagogical tool is already well established
in art and design schools.</p>
<p>Designing an exhibition as a holistic practice means producing content,
selecting it, thinking about the coherence between the pieces, the
general meaning, designing the scenography, the graphic identity,
writing the texts presenting the content, mediating with the public,
etc. It then involves a wide range of skills and is a valuable exercise
for both the teachers and the students. Exhibition is also a very
interesting form of production within schools, because it can only be a
collective process, engaging the teaching team, the technical ones and
the students to work together.</p>
<p>Ideally, students should be included in all these steps as much as
possible, so they have a global vision of the entire creative process
and can integrate into a single object the learning of various skills
through experience, which the teacher accompanies. You become a
blacksmith by forging.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is not always possible — due to logistical and
budgetary conditions — to include students in all the steps of the
work. There are indeed different levels of students&#39; engagement and
collective dynamics possible. In our schools, we often get them to focus
on a particular aspect of the whole exhibition work in order for them to
learn bit by bit, by digging into one task and observe, sometimes help
for the other ones.</p>
<p>As part of the DTCC project, we had planned to create an exhibition at
Esadse, to share the work accomplished over two years. However, as our
thinking progressed, it seemed more appropriate to envisage a form of
collective exhibition in collaboration with our partners and with the
participation of students from the three schools.</p>
<p>After considering the idea of a nomadic exhibition — which posed a
number of logistical problems — we finally settled on the idea of three
exhibitions, one in each school, which would be both similar and unique.
To this end, we are working with EKA and HfG to define common content,
from which the three exhibitions will be developed. We also agreed that
we all want students to be at the core of these exhibitions. Considering
that their experience of our international collaboration and what it has
generated in terms of experimentation, reflection and friction, is what
the project has generated most richly, we have decided that these
exhibitions will be structured around video interviews with the
students.</p>
<p>On top of those interviews, we&#39;ve decided to add, a certain number of
items to the list of the ones to be optionally included in the
exhibitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collaborative video game made by ESADSE teachers.</li>
<li>Video filters programmed by ESADSE students.</li>
<li>Games created during the workshop at ESADSE.</li>
<li>Collaborative manifestos produced by EKA students.</li>
<li>Interfaces and prototypes made by students during HfG&#39;s workshops.</li>
<li>Semester projects by EKA and HfG students.</li>
</ul>
<p>This content will be shared between the teams, each of whom will make
their own selection of elements to include in the curating of their
exhibition. We are also considering the possibility of freely
distributing this content online, so that other exhibitions could take
place. The scenography of each exhibition will then be designed
independently by each school. A graphic identity will be defined
together and be the visual link of the exhibitions.</p>
<p>What is most interesting is that the process of making those exhibitions
is creating various inter-related group dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li>International collaboration between teachers of ESADSE, EKA and HfG.</li>
<li>Internal collaboration within the pedagogical team of each school.</li>
<li>Cooperation of the technical teams of each school.</li>
<li>Participation and contribution of the students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, the students were not directly involved to define the issues,
objectives and content of those exhibitions, but were invited to
contribute in various ways and at different stages of the process.</p>
<p>The first part of this chapter is devoted to student interviews, which
are at the center of each exhibition.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll then explain the different ways in which we hope to involve
students in the exhibition project, and the pedagogical goals of their
participation.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="page article">
        <h2 id="students-interviews-at-the-center-of-the-exhibitions">Students&#39; interviews at the center of the exhibitions</h2>
<p>After the last workshop at HfG, in November 2022, we met to decide on
the next steps of our collaborative work.</p>
<p>At this stage, despite the involvement of our students in all stages of
the project, we had not yet documented their feedback and personal
reflections on our working subjects. In addition, we didn&#39;t feel that
the output from the workshops and the work carried out during the
courses were sufficient to capture what&#39;s at stake in the
collaborations, considered as processes that are always in-progress.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the students&#39; productions provide food for thought and
formulate proposals concerning collaborative creative tools, we feel
that their feedback on our international collaboration and what it
generated in terms of questioning tools, positioning practices and the
cohabitation of different ways of working, express more explicitly what
is at stake in collaborations, through and beyond the technical devices
on which they are based on. It seems to us, therefore, that if the
students&#39; productions are to be presented at the exhibition, they must
necessarily be accompanied by a reflexive form, enabling us to enter
into the collaboration itself, beyond the productions that have resulted
from it.</p>
<p>To do this, we chose to interview the students. These interviews took
the form of videos, an easy-to-exchange format. We decided to ask the
students to answer in the language with which they felt most
comfortable, and to subtitle them in English and French. We, teachers
from the three schools, collaboratively wrote a series of questions
that we felt were representative of all the topics covered over two
years:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the most interesting aspects of this cooperation between
three countries?</li>
<li>What was your biggest surprise during this trip?</li>
<li>Can you describe the best and/or the worst moments during this
workshop or any workshop?</li>
<li>What was the main insight on collaboration during this workshop?</li>
<li>Do you have an anecdote of something you experienced during the
project that stuck in your mind?</li>
<li>Was there any remarkable input of one of the project partners or
international team members for you?</li>
<li>What does collaboration mean to you? How can it succeed in the
digital space?</li>
<li>What have you learned about digital collaboration during this
project?</li>
<li>How can we enhance creativity in the digital space? Share your
insights.</li>
<li>What did you learn from the other partner schools and their approach
to design?</li>
<li>Please describe the communication with your international
team-mates, how was it for you?</li>
<li>Was the outcome of the workshop week different from the usual school
projects that you are doing at home?</li>
<li>What did you learn or observe in this project that you will take
away for your professional or personal life?</li>
<li>What&#39;s next for collaborative creativity?</li>
<li>What would you do to deliberately screw up a collaboration project?</li>
<li>What would you do to save a messy collaboration situation?</li>
<li>What would you bring from digital collaboration into real life?</li>
<li>Can digital collaboration ever be intimate?</li>
<li>What is the point of collaborating with someone who works very
differently from you?</li>
<li>Were you able to combine different working methods in your group or
did one method take over?</li>
<li>What is interesting about collaborating with someone who works very
differently?</li>
<li>What would you bring from digital collaboration into real life?</li>
<li>Do you think tutors in the project should have taken the very
different study cultures more into account?</li>
<li>We know that digital spaces may build barriers between people. Where
do they offer chances?</li>
<li>Do you think you learned anything during the pandemic to design for
that question?</li>
<li>Is there anything we can do to improve the quality of the creative
process in the digital space?</li>
<li>How does it work to get to know someone new in the digital space?</li>
</ul>
<p>We then submitted them to the students, who each selected three
questions and responded to them on camera. To ensure consistency between
our materials, filmed in three different locations, we defined common
rules for filming, lighting and temporality. We produced a total of 22
videos, which will be broadcasted in each exhibition.</p>
<p>Here is a list of reflections from student interviews that we have tried
to summarize and compile here, they are sometimes intriguing even
contradictory and can occasionally seem out of context, but are always
rich in learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshops are propitious moments to get out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li>Students had to reevaluate their way of thinking and working in
order to collaborate.</li>
<li>During workshops, a lot of ideas popped up in a very short time.</li>
<li>Reaching a group cohesion can be tough.</li>
<li>Students within a team really wanted to work on the same subject but
from very different point of views which were difficult to bring
together.</li>
<li>Different working methods sometimes are incompatible.</li>
<li>It&#39;s difficult to get a tangible project by the end of the week.</li>
<li>The project led to a new understanding of the distinct design
methodologies by students.</li>
<li>They felt like those collaborations were an insight of what they
could experience later on in a professional setting.</li>
<li>It&#39;s essential to work with people who have a different way of
working in order to learn from each other. Moreover, if different
perspectives manage to converge, the project is bound to be richer.</li>
<li>There will be a bright future for creative collaboration.</li>
<li>Collaboration is a question of trust.</li>
<li>The project allowed most students to gain a lot of self-confidence.</li>
<li>They learned a lot about methods.</li>
<li>Methods and tools are not neutral and shape our way of thinking and
our way of working.</li>
<li>We cannot separate the tools and methods.</li>
<li>Collaboration is not an end in itself.</li>
<li>The communication can be natural: &quot;each of us proposed ideas, as a
ping pong game&quot;.</li>
<li>Sometimes it is difficult to make decisions intuitively when you are
used to follow a certain process.</li>
<li>&quot;Listening to my gut feeling again from time to time&quot;.</li>
<li>Since there was a language barrier, students adjusted a lot through
sketches.<br>
<br></li>
<li>If you visualize something, you can come to a common understanding
much better.</li>
<li>In the digital space, the whole environment can be customized.</li>
<li>Good transparency in the process is a major issue.</li>
<li>Digital collaboration is not going to be something very intimate.</li>
<li>Digital collaboration is always intimate to some extent: &quot;We&#39;ve
all seen someone&#39;s cat run across the screen&quot;.</li>
<li>It&#39;s difficult to take remote relations from a business level to a
personal level or even to another level.</li>
<li>The emotions disappear quickly in video-calls.</li>
<li>Misunderstandings have a snowball effect and become bigger when
collaborating at a distance, because it&#39;s harder to communicate
clearly.</li>
<li>Remote communication is the same as in real-life, just more complex.</li>
<li>Varying feelings and emotions can be used successfully in group
work.</li>
<li>A computer is just a combination of ones and zeros, there is a risk
of &quot;over-humanizing&quot; it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This stage of the project, which involved gathering feedback from the
students, on camera but also in front of us teachers, turned out to be a
moment of reversed or reflexive pedagogy. The students, by asking
themselves and telling us with a critical and constructive approach,
what they&#39;ve learned, and what they&#39;ve appreciated or regretted, gave
us valuable feedback on their experience, but also on the limits of what
we have proposed during these two years of collective work.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="page article">
        <h2 id="involvement-of-students-in-the-making-process">Involvement of students in the making process</h2>
<p>Each in our own way, we are trying to involve our students as much as
possible in the design, production and mounting of our exhibitions.</p>
<p>Here is how we envision students taking part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some students with graphic design skills could participate in the making of a visual
identity.</li>
<li>During the exhibitions and associated events, students could present the work they&#39;ve done during and following the workshops and
express their feedbacks and learnings.</li>
<li>In ESADSE, Damien Baïs will lead a course where students will code some graphic programs that will
be a part of the exhibition and related to the collaborative videogame,
he and David-Olivier Lartigaud (ESADSE teacher) are starting to make.</li>
<li>In each school, some students will be involved in setting-up the exhibitions and present it to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will be invited to participate on a voluntary basis, except
when it is the subject of specific courses. It&#39;s very important to us
that they don&#39;t feel instrumentalized, that those who take part
actually have the will to do so. Some of the students who participated
in the workshops have already expressed their willingness to be involved
in the exhibitions.</p>
<h3 id="programming-of-bugs-by-esadses-students">Programming of bugs by ESADSE&#39;s students</h3>
<p>For the exhibitions, and following the workshop on collaborative games,
the ESADSE team decided to specifically design and program a
three-dimensional cooperative game in which the players will face each
other (so they don&#39;t see the other player&#39;s screen) and have to talk
out loud in order to meet on the map. When they succeed, events will be
triggered in the scenography.</p>
<p>Indeed, students will be programming those events as part of ESADSE&#39;s
Digital Creation program, more specifically in Damien Baïs&#39; programming
course. These programs will generate graphic effects on the interviews
we have mentioned earlier, temporarily disrupting the videos broadcasted
on screens in the room when players meet in the game. We call it <em>bugs</em>.</p>
<p>What is the most interesting is that students actually will be hacking
their own videos, as a way to reclaim their form, which has been
entirely designed by the teaching teams. In order to do so, they will
design computer programs which will be connected to the game. The
exhibition then becomes an exciting pretext for them to do some
technical exercises. It&#39;s also an opportunity to include in the project
some students who haven&#39;t taken part in the workshops.</p>
<p>Apart from those &quot;filters&quot; and even though the game will mostly be
made by Damien Baïs and David-Olivier Lartigaud (Esadse teachers), it
will also be opened for students to participate if some of them are
interested in.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-exhibitions-with-students">Setting-up the exhibitions with students</h3>
<p>When we build an exhibition with students, it is interesting to involve
them from the beginning to the end, particularly in the technical
installation of the elements that make it up.</p>
<p>Involving students in setting up the exhibition is an opportunity to
pass on technical know-how applied to a particular object; that
they can use later in their curriculum. This may involve spatial skills,
craft skills (drilling, fitting a peg, choosing the right peg, and so
on), setting up technical devices, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of this series of exhibitions in particular, the
installation of the system linking a central computer hosting the game,
screens showing the videos and micro-computers enabling coordinated
actions between the game and the videos, is an interesting experiment
because it can be somehow reproduced for other purposes.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>In summary, the mounting of an exhibition is always interesting in terms
of sharing knowledge between students and with the support of the
teachers and technical teams involved. It is also a generally
cheerful; moment of collaboration when the &quot;hierarchy&quot; between
students, staff and teachers is less visible, everyone working side by
side towards the same goal.</p>

    <div class="page chapitre">
        <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this publication, we have aimed to specify the pedagogical positions
in our respective schools while also explaining how the experience of
international collaboration has challenged them. The document at hand is
a hybrid object, comprising testimonies, reports, theoretical texts,
thoughts, and various remarks that reflect the diverse methods and
approaches brought together for this project. To structure these
concluding notes, we propose to highlight the most salient elements: our
perspective on collaborative tools, the positive contrast between the
teaching methods of the schools involved in the DTCC project, the
significance of in-person meetings, and the pedagogical paths that have
emerged as a result of this collaboration.</p>
<p>The DTCC project as a whole has been centered around the topic of
digital tools for creative collaboration, whether conducted remotely or
in-person. From the perspective of ESADSE, we saw this as an opportunity
to further our ongoing critical work on the replacement of dominant
tools in art and design schools, such as the Adobe suite and the
communication, project management, and creative tools developed by GAMAM
companies. This pedagogical approach, which emphasizes &quot;digital
writing&quot; and authorial practices, encourages ESADSE students to think
critically about various aspects, including ecological and social
issues, as well as governance and data security concerns, in relation to
their projects and the tools they employ to realize them.We believed
that these questions, which are central to the pedagogy of the three
partner schools (EKA, HFG, and ESADSE), were at the core of the subject
of Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration. However, the desired
changes we aimed to implement across our respective schools did not
materialize. This discrepancy became a point of disagreement among the
project partners, highlighting our divergent positions but also
providing valuable learning experiences. The question of tools proved to
be less consensual than initially anticipated, and our collaborative
experience reaffirmed that the choice of tools is primarily influenced
by cultural, ideological, and even political factors. Consequently, we
had to invest time in both online and offline meetings to delineate the
project&#39;s scope, placing greater emphasis on the notion of
collaboration itself, which became a case study for us, rather than
solely focusing on the question of collaboration tools.</p>
<p>In our collaboration, we relied on the tools that we had in common,
placing a higher priority on usability rather than critically examining
our stance towards those tools. In light of this approach, apart from a
shared Wiki that was created for this project and serves as the
foundation of this publication, our remote collaboration was organized
using widely-used communication tools such as Zoom, Slack, Miro, and the
email applications provided by our respective schools. While we were
aware that this project wouldn&#39;t bring about significant changes in our
schools&#39; established practices, it did spark a collective and critical
reflection on the tools we already employ, with a focus on their
effectiveness in fostering collaboration. This process resulted in our
students taking strong positions and presenting intriguing proposals for
new tools or features that could enhance online collaborations.</p>
<p>In summary, we have recognized that the tools we currently use for
collaboration are primarily communication-oriented, with only a few
specialized productivity tools like Figma or Penpot catering to
collective creation. This realization has made it evident that there is
still a need for collaborative digital creation tools to be developed.
Hence, the significance of our initiative to build
<em>ourcollaborative.tools</em>, a catalog that showcases unique and alternative
projects fostering creative processes beyond the field of industry,
rather than offering pre-existing &quot;solutions.&quot;</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, from a pedagogical standpoint, the
in-person workshop format has reaffirmed its relevance, which is why we
have dedicated a significant portion of this publication to it. In
particular, the formation of working groups, intentionally including
students from each school in every group, has played a vital role in
fostering a sense of collaboration among them. The deliberate effort to
exchange perspectives and seek common ground has demonstrated the
professionalizing impact of this workshop approach. The diversity of
spaces and the range of proposals that have emerged highlight the
remarkable fertility of this teaching format, as long as there is a
commitment to documenting its outcomes. The establishment of a wiki has
provided a means to capture and preserve the activities in a faithful
manner. Alongside the wiki, the interviews conducted with the students
— which we have chosen to present in future DTCC exhibitions — serve
as a crucial component of this archive, providing an authentic testimony
to the significance of these collaborative moments for the students
involved.</p>
<p>In continuation, it is evident that the collaborative value of digital
tools, particularly in the creative field, cannot fully replace the
direct interaction of physical encounters. While collaborative tools
prove to be quite effective in a productivity-driven context with
well-defined project goals, their inherent digital nature (interface,
screens, etc.) currently falls short of replicating an essential aspect
of collaboration: the physical presence. The act of meeting others,
experiencing different cultures and perspectives, fostering
conviviality, and being &quot;contextualized&quot; beyond one&#39;s usual workplace
are elements that are challenging to simulate digitally. Hence, despite
the advantages of digital collaboration, there remains an irreplaceable
value in face-to-face interactions. At the conclusion of such a project,
it may appear self-evident, but putting it to the test has revealed that
creation springs forth from a broader and richer context than the mere
software framework of a multi-user interface. This realization
underscores the true value of an ERASMUS-supported project like ours.
Beyond the tangible outcomes achieved, it is the &quot;extras&quot; accompanying
the work sessions that have played a significant role in shaping a
mental space specific to creation. Cultural visits, friendly encounters,
and discussions outside of formal meetings have contributed greatly to
this process.</p>
<p>As affirmed by both students and supervisors, the diverse experiences we
encountered during this project have transformed our creative approaches
and consequently shaped our productions. Our work has become enriched by
embracing pedagogical and professional methods that extend beyond the
conventional practices of our respective countries. This clearly shows
the richness of the European territory, which, through its differences
and points of convergence, compels us to view collaboration as an
exercise in physical and intellectual mobility. It encourages us to
embark on a journey of cultural and formal discoveries while embracing
diverse approaches. In this dynamic context, remaining static is not an
option; instead, we are invited to be in constant motion.</p>
