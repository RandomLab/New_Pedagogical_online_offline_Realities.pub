## ourcollaborative.tools

As we mentioned several times before, we wanted to make an object that would serve us over the long term, a device that would be a synthesis of our research but that would also be a tool made in collaboration and to be used by designers, artists, students or academics for their own activities.

We first envisionned a toolkit but finally imagined a platform that would be both a design research object, a participatory archive, and a pedagogical tool.
This platform aims to be used by designers and artists who work on notions such as collaboration, cooperation, contribution, participation, creative process, free software (FOSS), computer development and visual arts.

We think about this platform as a participative and open data base dedicated to artists and designers for pedagogical and research purposes. All the projects listed in this catalogue contribute to the building of commons, through digital artistic devices. The artists and designers who implement them are – all in their own way – shaping frameworks to host collaborations (with peers, experts from other disciplines, inhabitants of a territory, other than humans, etc.). We are mostly interested in the ambivalent status of these productions that are both artworks and tools. However, we do not only aim to archive projects but also to document practices and study how artists and designers use, combine, twist existing tools and develop new ones, so they can fit to their working methods and not the opposite.

We are continuously working on its design and editorial structure and we will continue for some time. With a small team and through workshops, we would like to push this object as far as possible for it to really become a tool used for several purposes. This project is in progress, here is an abstract of our intentions and testing for ourcollaborative.tools.

### What's inside?

#### Project's sheets

Each project is presented in the form of a sheet that provides the title, description, year of creation if it exists, the author(s), a link to the source, usage, temporality, and a technical environment.

Notions are associated with each project, in connection with the articles.

#### Articles

We contacted several scholars and practicioners to enlighten us on their visions of creative collaboration : we asked them to write an article as close as possible to their sensibilities to have the most precise view on our subject.
Projects and concepts are associated with their text to create a fine relationship with the content of the catalog.

#### Lexicon

We wish to enrich the plateform with a lexicon of notions related to the subject: each notion is defined to be as accurate as possible.
Several relations can be create from and to the articles and projects

#### Mediagraphy

We want this catalog to be as rich as possible, for this reason we need references of articles, books, website on which our users can rely. We will feed this library with suggestions from guest authors but also from all contributors involved in the project.
We build this mediagraphy on the APA model to ensure its compatibility with current research and academy formats.

#### Image bank

We have chosen to leave a large part to the image, to favor large surfaces for interface illustrations and screenshots of indexed projects. For the articles, as we taking care of the typography, we want to accompany the text with a lot of illustration.

### How is it built?

We invited Benjamin Dumond from studio Bonjour Monde. Graphic and interaction designer, Benjamin build the graphic identity of the website and the logic behind the interface, we iterated together to design the usage.

The identity is strong and singular, we wanted to make this project also an artistic object. The development is ensured by our team as well as the editorialization, to be able to make it evolve and maintain it over several years.

The plateforme is made in two parts :

At first, the back office is built on the Django framework and consists of a Rest API that publishes all content in JSON format, which allows us from the same data to build other graphical applications. Django is adapted for content-rich platforms and can be resized according to evolutions.

The frontend is based on vue.js which gives us a lot of adjustment possibilities during the various tests and allows quick corrections

The database system is still under developpement mode and will be migrate to a PostgreSQL database soon.

All is based exclusively on free softwares including the interface design with Inkscape and of course the development of the platform (django and vue).
All the sources will be available to be explored a posteriori.

### How to use it?

The platform is designed to create a maximum of relationships between the different objects that constitute it. 
The general idea is to offer as much variation as possible to explore the content.

#### Explore

It is possible to approach the content in different ways:
- by the index of all the projects with a focus on image
- by a search with occurrence in the different objects (projets, notions, articles)
- by the relationship between notions, articles, projects and authors.

A range of filters allows you to shuffle the data to navigate through the information.
We are still thinking about other relationships and objects like tools, licenses, languages

#### Make connections

The entire platform is built on the relationships between content, it is also more symbolically a community of creators motivated by the idea of ​​creative collaboration.

#### Participate

We will feed the platform initially by our solicitations to the creators and researchers, from our network to an active research of projects but we are thinking about a way to make it a more open participative tool.



### What will come next?

This platform is thought from the start as a shared catalog and an educational tool, which we want to grow up and use in our school and the partner schools.

User testing and improvement during workshops
=> Open Open, 11-12 May 2023, Cambrai (FR)

editorial (sheets, participation modalities, licences, curation) + design (other forms, how could it become more of a tool? web to print version with selected content ? => make your own curation within the platform by selecting authors, dates or notions associated)
