## Students' projects

#### Authentic emotion capture in digital collaborative working spaces

#### What is this tool for?

In the digital collaboration era people tend to lack emotional connection in the workspace. They are working with computers rather the people using them. This tool makes it easier for co-workers to create emotional connections, it helps start conversations both about work and personal life and it lets you see authentic feedback of your work.

#### How does it work?

When you are viewing your co-worker's frame, motion capture system starts detecting your facial expressions. When you have a distinctive reaction a picture is taken of you and posted in the frames corner. You can add a comment to explain your recation or make a face with a stronger emotion to change it. You cannot delete your own reaction but others can.

#### What did we make?

Within 4 days we made a Figma file with different components that could be added to Miro or Figjam. We also recorded a video with 3 scenarios of the ways the tool could be used after drawing storyboards. In the end we made an explaining poster with pictures of scenarios.

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

This is made as a new feature for digital collaboration tools like Miro and FigJam.

#### How does it impacts the collaboration?

Digital collaboaration is often very serious and it lacks emotional connection. With our solution people would give insight into their mood and working spaces. By making the workspace more intimate by creating an emotional connection between people. It also makes it less formal and more fun so people would feel less anxious and alone while working from distance.

#### How did we came up with this idea?

At first we came up with a few ideas which would be interesting to work with concerning digital collaboration and cursor qualities. We thought about gamification, making the work-space less formal and more connecting. We then defined the problem we see in digital workspaces - that people lack emotional connection that they usually have because they see face to face. We then started brainstorming about different ideas and stuck with the one where a picture is taken of you automatically to ensure authenticness.

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

The solution can be compared to the stickers feature because they also show what the other person is feeling. With our solution the reactions are real and authentical as you cannot fake them but whilst using stickers you can choose whatever reaction even if you don't feel that way. Seeing people's faces also makes you more familiar with them making it more comfortable to work.

#### What is this tool for?

FaceCursor is a short program which come with a simulation of an interface, introducing a webcam into the mouse clicker. This tool could be used to reinvent the conception of video content using live, for example. On the other part, it would become an add-on to integrate to our operating systems, enabling us to get rid of a simple videochat software to move towards something between TeamViewer and Facetime (or the good ol' Skype). 

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

This tool is obviously destined to a sychroneous collaboration, far away from an "emoji" or "thumb up" discussion... It could be also cooperative, if we imagine some additional features like drag'n'drop or clipboard action that involve a simultaneous user's clicking. For the moment, you have the possibility to draw directly on your "mouself", like a Paint extended to live webcam.

#### How does it impacts the collaboration?

FaceCursor clearly doesn't claim to be a huge innovation, the "cool" blending of several existing tools put apart. 

#### How did we came up with this idea?

The inspiration for this project came from our frequent use of Snap or Instagram filters, but also with this ability to move your face anywhere on the screen, when you are in a Facetime or Messenger call on a smartphone (or similar device). 

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

The difference with an overknown tool like Miro or Figma is the add of the mouse pointer with live camera on integrated, and the ability to get a "real human" interaction with it.

#### Autonomous mouse pointer
##### student's names

#### What if your mouse pointers were retired?

Thanks to the Leap Motion Controller, there is no more need for mouses or even for mouse pointers so they are now retired and living they're best life as autonomous pointers. Let's see what this one is busy doing in the background.

### Conclusion and openings
This week was productive in exchanges, experiences and design. Many tools were modeled by students and figured a large variety of intentions that seek new ways of interacting with each others. We witnessed moments of skills and tools sharing in between the members of teams, which was really intersting in the way that the separation between our schools pedagogies went porous through students. 

During this third and final workshop, we, the teachers, also got the chance to discuss about how to render all the work done. Different formats were considered to disseminate the work, we decided on an exhibition in each school but with similar content: video interviews of the students who participated in the workshops, with the same questions, that we collectively wrote. As we were in the context of the workshop, we were constantly having informal feedbacks on the workshops from students. We felt that – as they were the ones who were the most concerned by the work done and by our experience of collaborating together – we should give a place of choice to their testimonies and reflections on the subject of digital collaboration.
