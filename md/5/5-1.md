## Let's kill zoom calls : HfG's workshop, 21-22 November 2022, Schwäbisch Gmünd (GE)

Florian Geiselhart is a computer scientist and was a temporary professor at HfG. During the pandemic, he created hfg.design 1.0 as a teaching platform and is now working on the 2.0 version. He accompanies students on projects both at the technical level and on their design.

### A quick overview of...

Florian talks about the tools we use to work together remotely. Most of the collaborative tools are build for the productivity and not for the creative work.
We can't argue on Zoom.

Some thoughts we brought together about Zoom: 
- communication is always on on Zoom, not on-off
- it enables us to be together, yet we are separated
- what about when we are not talking but still communicating?
- many conversations are happening at once
- how to share mood, not only informations?

Then, we played a game to break the ice: Two thruths and a lie.

### Making teams

Each students wrote on a piece of paper their thougths about all the subjects related to video calls they talked about during the first days. Here is an excerpt of the ideas gathered: 

![miro_notions__20221122.png](img/miro_notions__20221122.png)
<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

- you can do you're own break when working remotly
- you can't really assess how other person feels
- non-verbal clues are important
- feelings of closeness or distance to others depending on their location in the room is absent via Zoom
- legs are hidden
- "synchronization" between people when someone is talking, is easier to avoid speaking at the same time
- how to have a view on workprogress of others?
- physical touch is missing
- getting up to stick the post-its to the wall is missing
- the truth/lie game would be not so funny on Zoom
- little chats in between meetings
- smell of a room
- sitting together
- side-talks
- seeing the emotions (gestures/mimics ) of other participants that are not talking
- rudimentary extraclass interactions
- breaks (all at the same place) are missing
- everyone would talk to each others after a IRL meeting, not as a whole group
- natural group-building
- small talk
- chilled atmosphere
- eye contact
- direct feedback because everyone is muted
- work/life balance
- being in the same environment/experience the same environment as the others

After gathering our ideas, we formed the groups by mixing the students as much as possible, the teams are made above all on the basis of their center of interest.

### Teamwork

After first day ended, the rest of the week was dedicated to work on teams' projects that were presented at the end of the international workshop week in HfG.

## Projects made by students

#### Echo

##### Maëlys Bard, Alféa Morelli, Lars Dörper, Maximilian Becht

<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

*echo* is a 2D virtual environment that allows users to move around in a videocall space. We focused on the spatial and sonic aspect of group work by imagining that it would be possible to move closer to the people you want to listen to and further away from others rather than mutating to simulate the sensation of sharing a space with other people. In echo, users can interact with each other in many ways such as sharing a presentation, activating magnetism to automatically follow the person as they move, or teleporting to each other. The idea of this project is to get away from the strict and static aspect of the grid.

#### Who is this tool for?

Our software can be used by creative teams that need to work remotely, by groups of friends or by companies, mostly large groups.

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

On *echo* you can work alone while keeping in direct contact with your workmates, work all together the same time or just present your work and hold meetings. It's a polyvalent tool for many kinds of collaborations.

#### How does it impacts the collaboration?

We thought *echo* as a way to keep a connection between people immersing them in the same environment so they can feel close to each other and to create a unity feeling wich is so important in collaboration. 

#### How did we came up with this idea?

First we defined, with the other groups, the problems encountered with zoom as well as the things we would have missed if the first day of the workshop had taken place in videocall. 

Our group focused on the following points: 
 - non-verbal clues
 - small talk/side talk
 - feeling the vibe of the other collaborators
 - local serparation
 - chilled atmosphere
 - being in the same environment/experience the same environmentas the others
 
From those points came the idea that the most effective way to dynamize a videocall would be to be able to move. That's how we decided to kill the grid. We applied the "morphological grid" methode to consider all possible actions to get rid of the grid. Many ideas came from this exercise and we had to think about the form that our project would take for the restitution three days later.

#### Why is it better than Zoom?

Zoom avoids the sensation of forming a group by freezing us in one place and removing the sensation of being in space in relation to others. With *echo* the videocall experience is more human and interactive.

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

*echo* is similar to *Spatial Chat* witch have the same sound spatialization system but the moving control are less intuitive and it try to reproduce a kind of reality while *echo* is really minimalist and sensitive, we've tryed to reproduce the sensation of being in a team, not just in a virtual open space.

#### eyesync

##### Leoni Stein, Enis Sentürk, Philipp Roser

First we started asking ourselves why eyecontact is not working and is nessesary for us. Soon we found out that conversations on the side have a huge impact on the authenticity during a meeting.

#### Why we have no eyecontact during zoom calls

- you see everyone at the same time 
- you look at yourself 
- you don't know if someone is looking at you
- every device has a different grid (of people)
- sometimes the camera is off

#### Why do we need it?

- for direct feedback
- for inclusion
- for when you need to stay focused
- for emotional connection
- to feel spoken to
- to feel heard

#### "How might we" questions

- How might we make someone feel listened to?
- How might we show two people that they look at each other?
- how might we solve the problem of having side conversations without disrupting the host?

The technology we want to use is called eye tracking. For this we use an API called *webgazer*.

#### re.act

#### Roman Samarskyy, Sarah Fütterling, Tobias Reinhart

![header.png](img/header.png)

#### What is this tool for?

*re.act* is a tool for online meetings. You can talk and listen to others depending on you location in the room. You can let participants know how you feel about something that's happened on the call at all times.

#### Who is this tool for?

The tool is for any kind of project group, teaching situations and teams working together simultanously.

#### What type of collaboration is it for (sychroneous/asynchroneous, collaborative/cooperative/participative)?

It is for real-time collaborations.

#### How does it impacts the collaboration?

It makes it easier to connect with other people in the room.

#### How did we came up with this idea?

The goal of the workshop was to reinvent digital communication and kill a certain thing about Zoom calls that annoyed us the most.

We picked sending reactions as our feature that we wanted to target because when you're in a call it's impossible to let others know your reaction to something that's happened in the call the way you can in a real room. Others can't hear you laugh or listen to your comment without everybody hearing it - or nobody at all. 

We started our project by collecting "How might we..?" questions and picking them apart layer by layer by asking us "Why do we want to do this?", then aswering the question and asking ourselves again "Why do we want to do this?" for the answer. In another direction, we asked "What's stopping us from doing this?" to further identify the problems.

Finally, we were able to summarize our findings in the following questions:

![hmwfinal.png](img/hmwfinal.png)
<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

We then started researching other tools that let us send reactions as a competitor analysis.

![competotor.png](img/competotor.png)
<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

Most of these let users send emojis to react to anything. We started to pick apart a lot of emojis and tried to find the most important ones that most people associate the same meaning with.

![emojiclassification.png](img/emojiclassification.png)
<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

Most emojis have multiple meanings and some are easily misunderstood. So what are the most important ones and what can we use them for? After many discussions we chose a small set of reaction emojis that we identified as the most important. They are classified into three categories: action, reaction and emotion. The final set is framed grey.

![emojiclassfinal.png](img/emojiclassfinal.png)
<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

The next step was to create a concept that we then could turn into a prototype. For this goal we created a flowchart that shows how reactions can be sent and how our digital meetings work overall.

![flowchartconcept.png](img/flowchartconcept.png)
<figcaption>Presentation</figcaption>

Then we sketched out first ideas of what our interface and reaction process could look like visually.

Our result is an online meeting tool that allows you to move freely in the room and therefore to pick a seat and seat neighbors. You can talk to the peole you sit close to and hear those further away too but more muted.

![seat.png](img/seat.png)

You can send reactions to a specific person, a group of people or the whole room depending on where you drop the emoji after you dragged it out of your selection.

You can recieve reactions as well, and like any other tool it allows you to do all that while listening to a presentation or watching a shared screen.

#### Why is it better than Zoom?

It's better than Zoom because it reflects what a meeting in the real world would feel like. You have many opportunities to chose your actions such as your location in the room and who you talk to and who you want to let your reaction know.

#### What other existing tools could it be compared to and why is it different?

The tool uses all of the basic features that Zoom offers too but has extentions that are connected to the real world. It is similar to the app "wonder" which lets people walk to different places and chose their talking partners as well.
